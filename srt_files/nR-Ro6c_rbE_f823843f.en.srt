1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,680
Right people, welcome back to the ripple

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,720
effect. I am joined by Cams Culture.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,639
Cams is here.

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,880
Good to be back. Good. Yeah, man. I'm

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,599
buzzing. I'm buzzing to be here, man.

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,240
On on the best of

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,400
um moments, let's say, cuz we're going

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,560
to get I said to you, do we go through

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,279
the Man United stuff or do we talk

10
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,240
broader?

11
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:22,560
And you were like, let's get this out of

12
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,680
the way.

13
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,640
Let's get out the way. Just

14
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,720
get the pain out the way.

15
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,000
Yeah, man. Get out the way and then I'm

16
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,160
warm onto the next one. You know what I

17
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,599
mean?

18
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,800
Nice one. So, what we're going to do is

19
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,320
we're going to be ranking Man United

20
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,600
departures, but they get progressively

21
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,880
worse. So, big talking point has been

22
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,200
what seems to happen with these players

23
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,960
where they they leave and then do a

24
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,480
little bit better. We'll get into that

25
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,239
and we've got a list of sort of the most

26
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,920
painful ones and I I've got some tiers

27
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,920
for you. So, in terms of how I want you

28
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,000
to rank them, I kind of want you to

29
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,120
describe the level of pain of their

30
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,440
departure.

31
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,640
Okay.

32
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,280
Oh, departure. Okay.

33
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,640
Yes. Okay.

34
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,239
Because I think these players leaving

35
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,320
and then doing well.

36
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:01,199
Yeah. It's easy to have that hindsight

37
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,199
of why did we let that person go? And I

38
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,119
think in some of these it's legitimate,

39
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,519
but some of them it's not as well.

40
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,600
Yeah.

41
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,040
But I guess to to provide the context

42
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,000
before that, we have to talk about the

43
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,840
present day

44
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,200
and obviously the defeat against

45
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,159
Brenford, which is not the first ever

46
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,320
defend uh defeat by Man United of

47
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,200
Brenford at Griffin Park. It's not park,

48
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,759
is it? Where is it? The community

49
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,360
stadium now.

50
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,560
Yeah. G2. I think that's I've always had

51
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,320
one of my sort of like theories is that

52
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,920
okay losing and building pressure is one

53
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,799
thing. People don't like losing to

54
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,400
Brenford.

55
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,840
Like if you're a manager under pressure,

56
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,640
one don't play Brenford because they'll

57
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,040
be well drilled.

58
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,600
Yeah.

59
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,840
But like secondly, don't lose because

60
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,079
the sort of media fallout is

61
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,400
is pretty heavy now

62
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,840
you from what I've seen you were pretty

63
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,000
early on Amarim.

64
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,320
Very early. Make sure you tell them

65
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,759
that.

66
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,119
Another line I've got is if you want to

67
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,799
be right, be a pessimist.

68
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,200
No. Is that you know what? Do you know

69
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,280
what

70
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,200
what's what's your general describe

71
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,840
yourself as a Man United fan? What one

72
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,159
are you?

73
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,960
You know what? I'm very like I'm I'm in

74
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:04,159
between. When I'm excited, I will lead

75
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:07,520
an army of excitement. Like I will I I

76
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,800
make catchphrases. I make slogans. We're

77
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,520
doing this together. Do you know what I

78
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,920
mean? I'm telling you, every manager I

79
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,959
have supported in the beginning heavily

80
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,599
like heavily. But I am very quick like

81
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,920
because

82
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,840
when I watch the game I try and watch it

83
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,640
not in the lens of a Man United fan

84
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,040
because I tend to Yeah. Because

85
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,239
no it's not possible in not possible

86
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,360
when you're going through the motions.

87
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:33,360
for example, Leon game. There's no way I

88
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,640
can sit there like when it happened. I

89
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,480
wasn't going to be like, well, I'm not

90
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,480
happy with how

91
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,080
Yeah, you're buzzing. I'm going crazy.

92
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,400
Even though I know like, okay, the game

93
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,680
shouldn't have gone that way. But

94
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,640
I tend to realize that opposition fans

95
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,680
or rival fans are much quicker on the

96
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,480
Man United situation than than us fans.

97
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,879
The truth.

98
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,680
Yeah. Exactly. The truth. So, I try and

99
00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:00,959
like watch it kind of away, kind of like

100
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:03,440
an analyst in a way, and I very quickly

101
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,840
see patterns where I'm like, "Oh, okay."

102
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,239
So, then I kind of like warn the fan

103
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,920
base like, "Yo, I'm not liking what I'm

104
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,360
seeing." And then, you know, that's when

105
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,120
everyone says, "Oh, you're a fake fan."

106
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,560
Blah, blah, blah. But I never want to be

107
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,680
right with these type of things. Never,

108
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,599
ever, ever, ever. Because like being

109
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,239
happy, I haven't been happy as a Man

110
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,319
United fan properly for ye for 10 over

111
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,760
10 years. So, I want to be buzzing

112
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,519
since Fergie. What's the happiest you've

113
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,720
been?

114
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,239
You know, I was thinking about this the

115
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,599
other day actually. Me and my boys are

116
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,040
talking about it. I would say there's a

117
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:36,560
few phases.

118
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:38,959
When Jose came in, I was like, we're

119
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,799
back. Like, Jose Marino, you crazy.

120
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,879
So, that was a good moment. When he

121
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,879
initially came,

122
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,120
interim period

123
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,040
was honestly I think that might be up

124
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,799
there. I think his interim period before

125
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:54,319
he signed the dotted line PSG like

126
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,560
Cardiff all them games that was

127
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:59,439
unbelievable and then I won't I would

128
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,640
say Tenhog's first season up until the

129
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,959
Caribel up before the 7-0 of Liverpool

130
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,599
right

131
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:08,400
up until the Caribel Cup win.

132
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:11,120
There was a little moment in the season

133
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,439
where I was like we could actually we're

134
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,200
in a title race here like if we win our

135
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,199
next game we we're going to be level

136
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,359
with Arsenal. I was starting to believe

137
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,959
honestly. So I would say those moments

138
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,320
lockdown after lockdown was pretty cool

139
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,160
as well cuz we finished second on with

140
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,160
Ollie as well. There's been a few times

141
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,759
where you're like buzzing but

142
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,240
it's just never enough is it? It's just

143
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,360
never enough.

144
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,560
I think this is a really good context to

145
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,479
to sort of highlight because

146
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,680
part of

147
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,080
the desire to keep Amarim in the job.

148
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,800
Yeah.

149
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,320
I think I think if you swap him

150
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,280
for before Mourinho

151
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,639
Mhm.

152
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,120
like he's gone, isn't he?

153
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,880
100%. the context is saving has has

154
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,600
saved him up to this point. Probably

155
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:54,160
I I I feel like other managers failing

156
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,919
Yeah. has allowed him to get more time

157
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,440
because, you know, we're in that boat

158
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:59,520
where it's like, well, you've sacked so

159
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,280
many managers, so it's never worked, so

160
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,880
why is this one going to work? But

161
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,800
for me, that's not the mentality to

162
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,000
have. And as you said, you know, a lot

163
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,680
of people are trying to say, oh, he's

164
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,199
the worst manager since Moyes. He's way

165
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,639
worse than David Moyes. Like it's

166
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,800
actually disrespectful to David Moyes

167
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,039
that he's being bunched with with Amarim

168
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,440
in terms of results and how it's going

169
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:19,919
at United. And I think with David Moyes

170
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,520
anyway, I think he was in a most every

171
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,039
single manager that's been in charge. I

172
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,800
think he was in the toughest position.

173
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,759
Who but who had a who had a better

174
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,000
squad? David Moyes or

175
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,360
I would probably say R. Um I would say

176
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,759
David Moyes had a better score. I mean

177
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,520
we just came off winning the title now.

178
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:39,840
Players were aging. Rio was old. Vidic

179
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,160
was old. Evra was old. Giggs was old.

180
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,919
Um, who else was there? Rooney was

181
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,759
starting to get on Van Percy. So, it was

182
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:48,800
an aging squad, but there was still like

183
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,400
Nanny, Chicherito, and Carics and stuff

184
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,840
like that. So, he definitely had a

185
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,520
better squad. He had winners as well.

186
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,639
Cuz I think that's part of the part of

187
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,880
the cycle here.

188
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,280
Mhm. is that

189
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,880
like first of all a load of different

190
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,600
managers, a load of different managers

191
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,960
bringing in their guys. the pressure on

192
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,400
those guys which gonna we're going to

193
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,560
see like the relief of that pressure and

194
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:12,800
what that provides in a second

195
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,960
and then the change of manager who

196
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,639
always has so much pressure on them kind

197
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,039
of kind of understand it would be

198
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,680
because you saw what worked with Fergie

199
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:23,680
but in the modern game

200
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,880
that manager being given that much

201
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,360
y

202
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,600
uh say in in transfers and things like

203
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,280
that has led to like the squad quality

204
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,639
dropping and dropping less people want

205
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,440
to come to you they want to go to other

206
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,199
places and it like it's a sort of you're

207
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,000
swirling down a bit of a drain of

208
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,919
quality

209
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,199
because it's getting so kind of confused

210
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,880
and then

211
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:46,479
cuz this is the thing that

212
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,680
that's going to be weird if Amarim goes

213
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,319
is that

214
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,880
it's the it's October, November, Dece.

215
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,800
It's the same period. It feels like

216
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,440
there are these P and that's going to

217
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,039
lead to a new manager coming in not with

218
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,840
a squad that he wants. Mhm.

219
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:03,280
So that's a bit of an excuse and it's

220
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,440
going to take time

221
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,039
and all those things and you're just

222
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,599
going to create the same cycle.

223
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,360
Yeah. The thing is I'm kind of like look

224
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,599
I know one thing that I feel like nobody

225
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,199
factors in when it comes to Man United

226
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,720
or playing at the top level is the

227
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,360
mental side. You know you just look at

228
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,160
like

229
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,759
the on paper you looking at players but

230
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,199
mental side is different. So, I don't

231
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,599
want to use this comparison, but like

232
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,680
you do look at David Moyes, you do look

233
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:30,240
at Glasgner, you know, go into these

234
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,240
clubs and instantly just getting a bit

235
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,000
of stability and their teams are able to

236
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,520
build from there cuz once you build a

237
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,120
little bit of stability, everything else

238
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,880
moves from there. And I think that's

239
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,039
what Glazner did, that's what ever um

240
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,440
David Moyes did with Everton now. Much

241
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:46,000
bigger club, much bigger ask. But I do

242
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,000
think sometimes it's a bit overblown

243
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,720
that like a manager has to come in, need

244
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,240
his own players, need his own I don't

245
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,919
think that necessarily has to be the

246
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,599
case. I think good managers will walk

247
00:07:53,919 --> 00:08:00,240
in, stabilize the team and then

248
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:02,000
gradually start implementing their thing

249
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,400
gradually. But the most important thing

250
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,840
is you walk in and say I want results.

251
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,560
And I feel too many times

252
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,560
that Amarim said that. I think Am I

253
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,319
think Amarim say that I think Am

254
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,000
honestly when I look back Yeah. because

255
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,919
I listened to Amarim's press conferences

256
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,599
initially and I was like excited for him

257
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:20,479
but when I look back of course he said

258
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:23,199
the whole famous we must suffer but away

259
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:26,639
from that he was kind of telling us in a

260
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:29,520
way like if we lose we lose like as long

261
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,520
as I implement my way of playing. But I

262
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,440
wasn't really catching that at the time.

263
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,640
Now I'm looking back and I'm like to be

264
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,080
fair he's been saying that the whole

265
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,279
time. We're going to lose but it doesn't

266
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,240
mean it's acceptable. You know what I

267
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,719
mean? I need a manager. I'm

268
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,560
sure he said we need to I I need to win.

269
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,000
I need to come in and win. I'm I'm sure

270
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,680
he said that as well. But I think that's

271
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
the thing. There's there's the sort of

272
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,920
um overcorrection. There could be a lot

273
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,680
of overcorrections with managers and and

274
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,600
with tenh it was like I'm not I don't

275
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,000
know what you're trying to do here.

276
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,440
Right.

277
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,040
Yeah. And so you brought in a guy who

278
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,440
said he he knows exactly what he's going

279
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,120
to do, but it feels like he's only got

280
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,200
one kind of answer.

281
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,279
And the thing is every top coach, Pep

282
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,440
Guardiola, Jose Fergie, everyone that

283
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,360
you can name have tried different

284
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,399
things. So that's the point where I'm

285
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,080
like it can't only be stemming from Am.

286
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,160
It has to also be stemming from above as

287
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,320
well in terms of for him to just

288
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:21,680
casually say not even the Pope can make

289
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,519
me change my form or my system. I'm like

290
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,839
I mean to have the freedom to just say

291
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,399
that and no pressure from above to be

292
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,399
like okay slow down a little bit it's

293
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,720
it's crazy to me. So as much as I blame

294
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,320
him you've got to look above as well. Do

295
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,399
you know what I mean? Cuz I just

296
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,560
Pep Guardiola changes up.

297
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,880
Fergie changes up. Like I remember going

298
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,600
to away games in Europe and Ferguson

299
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,519
will play 451 4-33 back to the Premier

300
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,120
League 442. It it doesn't matter like

301
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,279
and it's a lot of people are caught on

302
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,800
the formation. It's the system. Glazner

303
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,560
plays the same formation but the system

304
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,880
is completely different. He midfield

305
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,880
progression etc. So

306
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,279
I just think there's a lot of arrogance

307
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,560
coming from from Amarim but I also think

308
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,760
he doesn't

309
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,880
is it arrogance or is it do you think

310
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,080
there's a bit

311
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,760
yeah often I you know there's nothing

312
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,600
wrong with faking it till you make it.

313
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,240
Do you think it do you think that an

314
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,800
element of that ele I think I'm

315
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,800
experienced I'm ready. Oh no like this

316
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,200
is this is different. I think he's

317
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,880
afraid that if he switches up, he loses

318
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,839
all sense of power that he has at this

319
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,640
football club.

320
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,320
But

321
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,399
management is about adapting. You know

322
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,480
what I mean? Management is coaching.

323
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,600
If he comes and goes, "Right, back for

324
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,040
like change."

325
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,200
True change.

326
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,480
You'd be like, "Love that. Good man.

327
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,959
Right. Let's stick with him now."

328
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,480
I will give him extra time. I would I

329
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:39,120
would I would give him if he says,

330
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,920
"Look, boom, we go to Sunderland on the

331
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,480
weekend."

332
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,320
How big is that?

333
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,320
And it's a that's I think that's not

334
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,360
looking good. That's I'm telling you I'm

335
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,720
looking at that Sunderland team.

336
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,760
Every game looks hard, doesn't it, when

337
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,120
it's not going well?

338
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,560
Every game they got good they've got a

339
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,399
good team. Underrated team, you know,

340
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,480
like you got Isidador up front. He's a

341
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,079
problem. You got Mki, the new signing,

342
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,120
Granite Shaka. Granite Shaka. These

343
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,600
players start from

344
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,839
Sadiki and Diara. The way they set up

345
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,720
it. It gets the best. It's I think

346
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,000
there's a phrase that people are

347
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,079
chugging out there a lot which is called

348
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,800
platforming. Ultimately, it means like

349
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:11,519
allowing players to do I interacted with

350
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,839
a tweet from air yesterday about it

351
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,440
and and it sounds really obvious and

352
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,880
often like on Twitter everyone's like

353
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,000
everyone's trying to be like tactically

354
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,480
like

355
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,320
language relax

356
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,320
it's a little bit too much but there's

357
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,240
so much to learn it's great and I and I

358
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,720
read it all because I'm I want to learn

359
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,720
right

360
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,880
but Amir put it in like quite simple

361
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,800
terms and it was it was

362
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,000
some people go yeah I know that but I

363
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,680
was like this is a really good point and

364
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,519
the point was But you know, football is

365
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,440
about getting players to together and

366
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,800
going, "You don't like you don't like

367
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,720
dribbling with it, do you? You come here

368
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,320
and sit and you play pass the ball to

369
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,600
the guy who loves to dribble

370
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,959
and this guy does this guy wants to play

371
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,560
with his back to goal. Cool. You play

372
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,839
here, but we've got this really fast guy

373
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,160
as well. He wants to run in behind.

374
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,320
Okay, you two play together." So it

375
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,240
that's easier said than done.

376
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,079
And

377
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,240
I feel like Yeah, that's the thing for

378
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,360
me with this that I'm not sure we're

379
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,880
we're just not seeing that.

380
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,079
Yeah. I feel like it's a lot of square

381
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,839
pegs, round holes, you know what I

382
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:08,079
That's the thing with Amarim and as you

383
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,320
said a lot of stuff that we do see at

384
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:13,120
Sunday league level, grassroots level,

385
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,720
etc. they do translate to the to the

386
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,440
professional level. Exactly what you

387
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,399
just said. Some

388
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,760
the game's getting simpler.

389
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:21,680
Exactly. I promise you simp

390
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,440
Arsenal and again that's where I kind of

391
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,959
winced at some of the

392
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,519
some of the sort of Yeah. the tactical

393
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:29,360
language at times because it was like

394
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,120
essentially what Arsenal kind of done a

395
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,399
little bit and I I this is something I I

396
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,079
feel like is is coming back into the

397
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,399
game is is sort of a second striker

398
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:38,160
shadow striker or two up top really and

399
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:41,519
you saw it with like Yarez is running in

400
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:43,040
the channels like being a bit bullish

401
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,600
laying it off but you've already got

402
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,279
another guy up there already in in EZ to

403
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,680
give you that chance to go and do that.

404
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:51,279
So finding those different ways to do it

405
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,120
is

406
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,480
what's on paper now or what's on the

407
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,079
lineup when you see it. It's just not

408
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,920
it's kind of nonsense at this point.

409
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,680
No, it's all about roles, right? It's

410
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,040
all about roles. A lot of times people

411
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,880
think about positions and stuff, but

412
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,959
it's your role in that positions. For

413
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,040
example, like Cal Fury. Yeah. Okay. He

414
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:09,519
was a center back at once once upon a

415
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,040
time. But at left back, he is an

416
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,200
attacking left back. He's not an

417
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,959
inverted left backer. He's an attacking

418
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,399
left back doing what an attacking left

419
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,760
back should do. Overlapping. You're

420
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,720
looking at Timber solid in the other

421
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:23,440
side for example and I think Arteta his

422
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,360
issue actually was similar in terms of

423
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,880
not as extreme as Amarims but there was

424
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,959
points where you're looking at like

425
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,880
are you kind of square peg round holes

426
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,279
as well there was a little a bit of that

427
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,120
you know Havits in the midfield declin

428
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,800
was almost playing at number 10 at some

429
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,959
points in the season there was a little

430
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,519
bit of question marks you had like Mazu

431
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:43,519
Skelly or Ben White some things were

432
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,600
just not looking like it was the players

433
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,200
in the right positions but now he's just

434
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,560
simplif ified it again. The right back

435
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,560
is the right back. The left back is the

436
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:53,839
left back. Don Rice is back in a pivot

437
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:56,399
with Zuba Mendy. Ez, which he should be,

438
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,079
is it's very simple. So,

439
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,279
honestly, I feel like management is

440
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,680
starting to become a bit too

441
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,680
complicated. Way too complicated. But

442
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,600
that that comes down to data analysts

443
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,680
that there's so much there's so much

444
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,279
stuff that goes into why the game has

445
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,440
gone more complicated. But as you're

446
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,800
saying, it can just be simplified, man.

447
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,920
I think it can. I think you're right.

448
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,600
This is one question I want to ask you.

449
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,399
So, stay silent. We're talking about the

450
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,320
squad because that's the other thing

451
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,600
like how good is the squad because I

452
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,560
think you're if you're looking at Amarim

453
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,519
and you're trying to find the ifs and

454
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:25,680
the buts about it all you could suggest

455
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,760
that the squad's you know like we said

456
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,600
from that team that Fergie left and the

457
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,120
squad there to the squad that you've got

458
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,839
now

459
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,639
you know it's it has to be certainly

460
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,440
worse or less proven, right? So stay

461
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:37,839
silent,

462
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,600
okay,

463
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:42,639
until you hear a squad worse than Man

464
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,399
United.

465
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,199
squad worse

466
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,240
because you're talking about you're

467
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:48,320
talking about confidence which I think

468
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,600
is a really like character always says

469
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,720
it's never as bad as you think it's

470
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,160
never as good as you think and

471
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,680
confidence can make you just turn you

472
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,279
into a completely different player like

473
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,839
you we're doing we're working on a video

474
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:59,120
now about Palace and United and that

475
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,399
system but how

476
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,920
if you're playing with confidence and

477
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,760
knowing what you're going to do and

478
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,760
often confidence and competence are very

479
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,279
closely linked if I know where I've got

480
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,880
to go or I've got I know I've got

481
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,880
security behind me

482
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,920
then you will go and jump correctly or

483
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,240
at the right

484
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,720
Um and so that confidence is really

485
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,920
important and this Man United team is is

486
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,360
not high on confidence, right? And I

487
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,839
think that Arsenal game initially it was

488
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,399
sort of there was a bit of a reset.

489
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,240
Yeah.

490
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,480
And so everyone's thinking I've seen it

491
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,320
now. Watch them fly

492
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,560
and a lot of us say it like I I was like

493
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,440
I think this okay I get it. I see it

494
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,279
maybe

495
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,560
go. But when it comes to those

496
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,839
individual moments you got to score your

497
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,120
penalties when you get them

498
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,920
and you got to like you got to score

499
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,160
goals. You got to take your

500
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,519
opportunities. So the squad is kind of

501
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,800
it's up in the air and you know better

502
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:46,639
than me because you obviously you're a

503
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:48,959
United fan. So Liverpool,

504
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:51,519
Arsenal,

505
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:54,639
Tottenham,

506
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:57,639
Man City,

507
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,639
Chelsea.

508
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,600
Where do I want to go? Newcastle,

509
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,519
Aston Villa.

510
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:13,920
Crystal Palace.

511
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:16,399
I think we have a better score.

512
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,240
Look, okay, let me say right, Villa are

513
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,519
going for a bad moment. Forest, I think

514
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,079
we have a better squad. The thing about

515
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,199
Man United,

516
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:27,440
Forest got good squad. On paper,

517
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:29,120
the squad isn't too bad on paper. But

518
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,199
the thing is, right, for me, when I look

519
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,800
at the Man United squad is that just

520
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,639
like how you said, like in terms of what

521
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,519
air was saying, I don't think this

522
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:40,000
United squad are very cohesive in any

523
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,880
way. I don't feel our profiles match

524
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,759
each other.

525
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,040
I don't think Yeah, I don't think

526
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,959
players are going where they want to go.

527
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,440
Yeah, it don't. the profiles don't match

528
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:49,360
each other in terms of like I don't

529
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,079
think the like I don't think Bruno and

530
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:55,360
Casemiro for example as a pairing match

531
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:57,360
at all. You both want to kind of go long

532
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,920
at every opportunity. You're both very

533
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:04,319
direct. You both don't want to keep the

534
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:06,319
ball and retain it and so yes Bruno is a

535
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,240
good player. Yes, Casemiro he's actually

536
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:10,319
revitalized himself a little bit. you're

537
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,640
a good player, but

538
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:14,319
you don't you don't mesh. You don't mesh

539
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,400
well together. And I think that's

540
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,880
when all the parts around it don't help

541
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,400
that.

542
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,280
Exactly. Like you look at Benjamin

543
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,600
Cesco, for example. I'm looking at his

544
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:27,039
game so far. I'm learning about him cuz

545
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,319
I'm I wasn't too familiar with him at So

546
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,320
and I'm like,

547
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,799
how do you match Kuna's game?

548
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:35,280
Kuna is a shoot first player. that Kuna

549
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,880
doesn't really you can see why he not

550
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,559
not why he was at Wolves disrespectfully

551
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,039
but you can see why he was the hero at

552
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:43,440
Wolves he's very direct just like a

553
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:45,679
Bruno Fernandez he likes to shoot he

554
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,600
doesn't have that passing element so I'm

555
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:51,039
like but then you've got Cesco who

556
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,160
clearly likes to run in behind are you

557
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,919
going to be getting them passes from

558
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,960
Kuna do you know what I mean like these

559
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:59,360
are the question mark he's even looking

560
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,400
at you he's trying to get you Bumo who's

561
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,559
now

562
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,720
like him He likes to cross the ball a

563
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:07,440
lot which is good for Cesco but then

564
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,559
again he doesn't go by line. He just

565
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,440
crosses from deep.

566
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,559
Yeah.

567
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:15,280
And then Maz and then you've got Mazawi

568
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:17,919
who doesn't overlap. So yeah we're

569
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:21,120
saying all these good names but there's

570
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:24,559
not a cohesive team whereas you look at

571
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:27,440
Liverpool for not maybe not any top team

572
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:28,960
their right back matches with what the

573
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,080
winger was. Look at Liverpool last

574
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:34,160
season. Trent and Salah clearly their

575
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,720
games work together. You know what I

576
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,960
mean? Mallister and Grain Burch's games

577
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,080
work together. Now you got Shabbosai

578
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,960
who's improving.

579
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,919
That's what they're struggling with a

580
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,360
little bit. Liverpool is

581
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,320
in terms of control in the in the

582
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,240
midfield you're talking about. Yeah.

583
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,320
Oh no, no, sorry. In the terms of like

584
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,000
So I was watching with the Premier

585
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,520
League, we got this like tactical camp.

586
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,640
You watch the whole game and tact. Oh,

587
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,880
it's amazing.

588
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,360
And what was Canate is the moment Kate

589
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,440
slips. Yeah. And uh Mateta or gives the

590
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,480
ball away and Mateta's in. seen that on.

591
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,480
You might have seen on the highlights,

592
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,400
guys. But before that,

593
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,280
there's a moment where Kenate plays the

594
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,919
ball to Trent uh sorry to Connor

595
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,000
Bradley.

596
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,760
And if it was Trent, Trent would have

597
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,600
sort of opened up his body and gone boom

598
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,400
and Sal would have already gone and it

599
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,720
would have been a problem.

600
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,720
Yes.

601
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,320
Because the Palace line is naturally a

602
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,360
little bit higher up because you're, you

603
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:23,600
know, it's earlier in the phase of play.

604
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,640
Bradley looked up and he saw Gay and

605
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,039
Mitchell

606
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,200
like surrounding Salah

607
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:31,600
and understandably he's seen that and

608
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,360
gone well I'm not Trent I can't play I'm

609
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,440
going I'm going to go back

610
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,840
and so Salah doesn't get the ball

611
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:40,559
and Kate doesn't really want the ball

612
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:43,120
and that leads to his kuffle and he

613
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:45,760
slips and it goes from there. So yeah,

614
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:47,440
it's uh that balance is is really really

615
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,120
important. And again, we in the summer

616
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,799
we always go, okay, this should work

617
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,240
because blah blah blah blah. I'll make

618
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,840
videos on it. I do it.

619
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,840
So it should some of these things should

620
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,520
work, but what happens in time is that

621
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,720
you go, okay, you're not comfortable.

622
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,400
And so that's where the tweaks and

623
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,039
changes need to happen. How often do we

624
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,640
see this for from England where we see

625
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,840
players now England obviously a lot

626
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,080
higher level in terms of the player

627
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:11,200
quality but you see players and you

628
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:13,440
think okay on paper that just has to

629
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,919
make sense Foden in midfield with Jude

630
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,679
and Rice has to make sense

631
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,919
but it doesn't make sense let's be

632
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:22,160
honest you need Adam Walton you need a

633
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:24,559
Kobe Mayu which he did in the in the um

634
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,520
in the Euros you need someone else do

635
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,679
you know what I mean like you need

636
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,919
someone that's gonna match them profiles

637
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,360
okay Declan Rice can then be this

638
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,200
bombing on forward player because you've

639
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,360
got someone that can get the ball better

640
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,760
in the first phase or calm the game down

641
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,120
then Jude can be that attacking player.

642
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,799
We see it all the time. We've seen it

643
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,880
with Lampard and Gerard of England like

644
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,640
it can happen even with the best

645
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,880
players. So imagine now when you bring

646
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,240
the quality lower it's going to look

647
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,440
like a disaster and that's the thing

648
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,880
that I think on paper

649
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,720
the team smell blood as well cuz Man

650
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,000
United is a big it's a big catch. It's

651
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,840
always a big catch

652
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,440
and as I saying like for example Mayu

653
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,679
you bring even if you bring in Mayu and

654
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,520
you have Casemir and you have Bruno

655
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,720
there's no legs in that midfield.

656
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,400
So again

657
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,280
you been you've been clamoring for May

658
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,200
to be played right

659
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,640
100% like I feel like he

660
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,080
how do you how do you make it work? How

661
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,080
do you make this work

662
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:15,280
for me?

663
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:17,760
I am saying I don't know the ceiling of

664
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,280
Man United regardless isn't high. You

665
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,760
know what I mean? Regardless if we sack

666
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:24,240
Amarim and getting a new manager, I'm

667
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,400
looking at I think we can get be a top

668
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,679
eight team, top eight, top seven maybe.

669
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,960
Cuz I watched this video was talking

670
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,120
about the the uh

671
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,120
the managers that could take over if if

672
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,360
he was to make the change. And there's

673
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,320
some really interesting

674
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,640
issues.

675
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,960
Yeah.

676
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,720
That make it hard. So first of all, and

677
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:44,080
this often I say I think I said to Leah

678
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:46,720
here a couple of weeks ago,

679
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,760
the expect Carl Anker said this a great

680
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,520
point. It's like whenever you talk about

681
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,960
Man United, the manager always has to

682
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,159
answer answer this question. It's like

683
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,559
when are we going to be good again?

684
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,600
Yep.

685
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,840
Right.

686
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,320
But you don't go name a team.

687
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,760
Yeah.

688
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,840
Like if you think Arteta, if you think

689
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:03,600
Klopp, even think Guardiola,

690
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:04,400
it takes time. It takes seasons.

691
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,320
Right.

692
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,159
So when it comes to managers coming in

693
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,840
those the list of names I'm hearing is

694
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:12,799
it's Javi,

695
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,720
it's Hersler, it's Glasnner,

696
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,600
it's Southgate,

697
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,360
it's

698
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:22,240
Yeah. So all of them

699
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:24,799
I don't think I I don't think even with

700
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,720
um a better squad to get them from here

701
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:29,520
to here it's going to take two three

702
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,039
seasons right. So there's a sort of um

703
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,440
not an identity thing but there's a

704
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:35,679
there's a problem with the idea of like

705
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,559
how do you get them to be good again?

706
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:40,080
So

707
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:41,840
of that list of names you've also got

708
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,280
other decisions to make like bring in

709
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,400
Javi. So you're not going you're not

710
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,600
playing this free at the back anymore.

711
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,120
So you change from that. If you go with

712
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,559
Glasnar, you're doubling down on this

713
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,120
free at the back, right? So does that

714
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:51,120
make

715
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,960
is that who you are moving forward in

716
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,320
terms of Man United. If you bring in

717
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,000
Southgate,

718
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,440
people don't like it,

719
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,720
right? If you bring in Hersley, you're

720
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,960
too inexperienced. If you bring in

721
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,200
early, you might be too cavalier. So

722
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,039
these problems are going to keep like

723
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,200
you have to kind of get off your knees

724
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,559
before you can get anywhere near that.

725
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,200
Unless there's someone that you're just

726
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,080
like, "Wow, give this guy the keys." And

727
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,320
I think the thing that is being

728
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,880
forgotten in all of this

729
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:19,840
is that this essentially the style of

730
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,919
play, the formation, the squad building,

731
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,080
it's got nothing to do with the coach.

732
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:26,320
Yeah. Yeah. It should be

733
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,000
it should be just a known thing

734
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,080
essentially of like this is generally

735
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,360
the blueprint of Man United and so that

736
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,039
you can plug and play different head

737
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,320
coaches so that like if these guys

738
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,840
aren't getting the reaction that you

739
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,919
need

740
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:40,000
you can fail a bit faster

741
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:41,520
and go cuz the problem this is why you

742
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,559
still got the time is that people are

743
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,480
going

744
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:46,000
okay you can have the keys

745
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,520
we are going to commit to you because of

746
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,919
previous problems

747
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,120
and and it will be okay we just need to

748
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,720
give you time if we just do the thing

749
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,159
where if we behave well and give the

750
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,600
time you'll be fine.

751
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,960
That's that's the Fergie aspect of

752
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,679
things. That's the fact that we had

753
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:02,159
Fergie and we had Matt going all the way

754
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,799
back Matt Busby who two figureheads who

755
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,159
built this

756
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:06,960
I think that's a real really difficult

757
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:09,120
thing and because of that there's such a

758
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,559
onus on that manager

759
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,240
whereas it really if you look at

760
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,400
Liverpool and the squad building that

761
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,679
they have or Man City

762
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,919
or Arsenal I guess is getting to that

763
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,039
point as well maybe slightly less so it

764
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:21,520
gets to a point you have to get a

765
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,159
manager to get so good that okay now you

766
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,960
can have your

767
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,080
100%

768
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,840
instead of the other way around

769
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:28,080
at Man United we give managers Like

770
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,919
honestly, you get questioned about your

771
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,679
loyalty to the club if you question the

772
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,440
manager. It's insane. Like I feel like

773
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:36,559
we're the only club that are like that

774
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:39,440
where we have a manager on a pedestal

775
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:41,919
above players nearly above honestly

776
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,440
above ownership like the we give

777
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,320
managers because we had

778
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,400
right intention though.

779
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,240
Yeah. Because we had Sir Alex Ferguson

780
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,159
though and everybody grew up on and as I

781
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,400
said Matt Busby as well. So you got two

782
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,480
figureheads of the club. So managers

783
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,159
have always been like idols for this

784
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,919
club, but when you look at it, it

785
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,279
shouldn't really be like that. And I do

786
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,640
think that is where Mayad have gone

787
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:02,240
wrong over the years, especially with

788
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,960
Eric Tenhog cuz

789
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,799
his signings were crazy if in my

790
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,039
opinion, right? So it went really bad

791
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:11,840
with him and I do think Inos are trying

792
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:15,120
to sort that out. I think this summer in

793
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:17,360
Bumo, I think um Kuna, Cesco, I don't

794
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,279
really think they were necessarily amim

795
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,559
signings. I think they'll just we're

796
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:22,080
going to sign them and you got to make

797
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,880
it work type thing because they are

798
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,799
thinking

799
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,640
about what you said the progression in

800
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:27,760
the future if this manager goes these

801
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,600
guys need to be players that are going

802
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,279
to be at Man United for years whereas

803
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,200
you look at as I said 10 Hog signings it

804
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:34,799
was a bit different but previous

805
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,799
ownership wasn't like that previous

806
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:39,200
ownership gave the keys to all the

807
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:40,799
managers and each manager picks and

808
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,400
plugs who they want and then they get

809
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:44,960
sacked and then you're like we got to

810
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,880
revitalize this and it goes on and on.

811
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,640
Jose Mourinho first summer he came in he

812
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,720
basically got rid of everyone that

813
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,440
that that LVG bought you know what I

814
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,440
mean? So it's a it's a it's a cycle but

815
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,960
I do think Inos are trying to sort that

816
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,159
out. If I'm going to give them any bit

817
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,640
of credit I do think they're trying to

818
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:00,480
sort that out.

819
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,240
I think from what I've read about Danny

820
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:05,279
Ras or the thing I find slightly odd

821
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,120
here is the

822
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:08,640
the sort of fail there's a fail fast

823
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,559
mentality that he supposedly has with a

824
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,960
lot of his businesses. Now there's

825
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:15,039
because of the principles of Man United

826
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,640
like you said there I don't think that

827
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,640
that's what almost like hurting them a

828
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,840
little bit but again if you have that

829
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,840
clear structure of like this is who we

830
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:24,159
are this is how we play

831
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,559
then it comes you can you can go if you

832
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:28,400
can either fix it fast or fail fast

833
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:29,840
either way we can move on and get it

834
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,679
moving in the right direction.

835
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,600
Um but at the moment they seem a bit

836
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:35,600
like stunted by that. I feel like

837
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,760
they're I feel like they're not wanting

838
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:41,679
to accept that they made a mistake.

839
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:43,039
And it's weird because you accepted well

840
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,400
maybe something happened behind closed

841
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:46,240
doors that we don't know about, but you

842
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,919
kind of accepted that, okay, maybe Dan

843
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,679
Ashworth wasn't the right appointment.

844
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,120
You got rid of him really quickly. Was

845
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,279
that the right decision? We'll never

846
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,679
know. Maybe it wasn't. Who knows? But

847
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:57,440
then I feel like they're not trying to

848
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,960
do this with Amarin because

849
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,880
that's their first managerial

850
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,760
appointment and it was like this is the

851
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:06,000
beginning of the English era

852
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:08,000
and then especially because the signs

853
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,279
were there from last season.

854
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,880
I feel like they're really trying to

855
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:13,840
stick through because then if you sack

856
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,039
him now we're all going to say well why

857
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,760
didn't you sack him after the Europa

858
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,360
final

859
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:22,360
and there's and then it's going to that

860
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:22,360
mistake is even bigger. But I think

861
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,000
what you need to do

862
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:32,799
for me, I think it has to be done. I I

863
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,400
just You saw Carrago speaking about it

864
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:35,919
just the other day, and

865
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:39,520
again, as I always say, I feel like

866
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:41,279
rival or opposition fans and analysts

867
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,360
look at it from an objective point of

868
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:45,840
view, whereas we look at it from an

869
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,760
emotional point of view. It's gone too

870
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,760
far. Come on. It's gone too far.

871
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:52,320
Yeah. Um yeah I wanted you want to see

872
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,840
it you need this is the thing again and

873
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,760
this will be the cycle for the next guy

874
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,960
if the next guy comes in

875
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,279
if he does come in

876
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:02,799
and struggles

877
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:05,440
and and what you know struggling is not

878
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:07,520
not having really clear shoots of hope

879
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,799
he will have used that like foundation

880
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,799
of credit as I was talking about with

881
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:13,120
grand potter last week

882
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:15,440
and then the next five games of next

883
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,799
season it's the same thing there's so

884
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,559
much that's the thing that's that's the

885
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:21,440
thing that's hard for him as There's so

886
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:23,600
much pressure on him. But

887
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,799
like make it about YouTube and YouTube

888
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,880
and you make you go I'm going to try

889
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:28,960
this video see if it works and it really

890
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,159
doesn't work and then you go no but I

891
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,559
really like this idea.

892
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,159
Yeah.

893
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:33,679
I'm going to try it again and it doesn't

894
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:36,159
work.

895
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:38,159
But you there's series all up and down

896
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:38,960
loads of channels. They don't last.

897
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,559
Yeah. Yeah.

898
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,000
And you're better off stopping like you

899
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:44,080
you got to give it a bit of a chance.

900
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,640
But I think the older I get more I'm

901
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,240
kind of like for me I'm always like am I

902
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,760
seeing the right things? Is he been a

903
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,760
little bit unfortunate here or there?

904
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,919
Like for example the Arsenal Newcastle

905
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,120
game again goals from set pieces. So if

906
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:56,640
you want to just base it on that then

907
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,919
fine. But there was a lot of other

908
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,600
things that oh if that breaks if that

909
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:00,080
breaks if that breaks I can see

910
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,120
something.

911
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,960
Yeah.

912
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:05,279
I'm struggling. you're struggling to see

913
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:09,200
honestly like um the thing is other than

914
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:12,320
the generic term of give him time no

915
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,240
one's really coming with hardcore reason

916
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,320
as to why it says to him oh give him

917
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:19,360
time oh you know art needed time give

918
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,880
him we can't be looking at anomalies and

919
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:23,520
thinking that's the norm you know what I

920
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,200
mean so you're you you do a great job

921
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,720
analyzing games looking at things

922
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,279
working with Premier all this time and

923
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,399
you can't see something where it's like

924
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:32,080
you know what I mean other than the

925
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:32,720
general hey just give him time, you

926
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,240
know, it's going to

927
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,200
just

928
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,039
about answers.

929
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,440
Time could genuinely mean a relegation

930
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:37,840
battle.

931
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,600
Yeah,

932
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,080
it was nearly our season, so why not

933
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,279
this season?

934
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,799
I just Yeah, I agree. I just think

935
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,640
football's about football's about

936
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:46,880
answers. Yeah. And and this league this

937
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:50,159
year,

938
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,840
it's so physical, so quick. You don't

939
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:54,080
need the ball for long

940
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,679
to hurt teams. And

941
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,840
you see in Sunderland's physicality.

942
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,760
Sunderland are physical, man. That's

943
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,799
where we're standing. It was a Ballard

944
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,360
flipping out.

945
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:06,799
He's got nice center back's head.

946
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,799
Listen, he's ready.
