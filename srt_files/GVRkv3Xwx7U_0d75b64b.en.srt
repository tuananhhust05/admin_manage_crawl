1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:06,080
Right people, let's talk Arsenal versus

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,639
Newcastle. So much to unpack here. Uh

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:11,360
something that I spoke about on my JLA

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,040
Substack. Actually, I got asked what do

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,120
I feel like is going to be one of the

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,640
sort of big changes this season. I feel

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,800
like I'm seeing it more and more. And in

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,199
this game, I thought that we saw it as

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,960
well. I want to talk about Yarez. I want

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,880
to talk about his performance in this

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,640
game. I want to talk about the big

12
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,039
changes that occurred in this game that

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,640
led to the game kind of ending up like

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,480
this.

15
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,079
And I want to talk about the back two as

16
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,600
well. And actually the goals as well. I

17
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,120
think it was really really interesting.

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,480
Yes, they were all from set pieces, but

19
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,000
there was so much more to be discussed.

20
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,160
Let's start off with the two teams here

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,200
and then we can get into Yokarez's role

22
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,399
because actually I think the other thing

23
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,280
we've got to touch on is like the

24
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:53,680
psychology of this win and what it does

25
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,399
mean. it it's so much bigger than just a

26
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,879
normal lastm minute win. I really really

27
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,800
believe that on reflection. Right, let's

28
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:03,840
get into it and then I'll explain all of

29
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:06,799
that because these are the two teams and

30
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,560
as we know we were expecting, you know,

31
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,000
Newcastle to defend it the way that they

32
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,920
naturally do. You know, they're going to

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,799
have that mid block of that five, but

34
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,640
you've got the likes of Bruno, Tanali,

35
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,920
Joe Linton ready to snap in. They're

36
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,400
going to be physical. They were

37
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,240
physical. You know, that's absolutely

38
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,840
fine with me if I'm honest. I thought

39
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,080
the game was really, really physical. I

40
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,920
think does it go a little bit too far?

41
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,520
Maybe a little bit here and there. But

42
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,960
also, if everyone just got on with it,

43
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,320
then no one would be moaning and it

44
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,439
would have been pretty even. You

45
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,920
probably don't like that I've just said

46
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,920
that, but I did. Sorry. Um, if you like

47
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,280
honesty, subscribe to the channel

48
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,200
because I think that's that's a good

49
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,159
thing to like, isn't it? Isn't it? Is it

50
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:48,240
not? It's not. Is it not? Is it not? Is

51
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:51,200
it not? It's not. Is it not?

52
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:54,479
It's not, is it? But is it not? That's

53
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,079
not, is it? Okay, good to know. Um, so

54
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,520
here we go. We got the two teams here.

55
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:01,200
And what I thought was really, really

56
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:04,640
interesting was how Arsenal were able to

57
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,079
break on the JLA subsack,

58
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,040
which we've got link in description. You

59
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,560
want to get involved, we've got some

60
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,840
really great articles in there, and

61
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,599
we're going to be doing having really

62
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,440
kind of quite niche chats with tactical

63
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,440
people, which is super exciting for me

64
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,680
to kind of learn more all the time. But

65
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,360
one question I got asked on our COP

66
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,319
unfiltered

67
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,879
uh video that I did the other yesterday

68
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:27,440
the other day was what's going to be the

69
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:30,959
next change in football. I think the

70
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,319
next change is two strikers up top. And

71
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,440
the reason I think that is I think

72
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:37,599
having that second striker, shadow

73
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,800
striker, whatever you want to call it, I

74
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,040
think is becoming more and more

75
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,640
important as teams look to transition.

76
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,239
Thomas Frank spoke about it a year ago.

77
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,840
He's been doing it for a long time, but

78
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,519
you're seeing it up and down the league

79
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,000
and you're seeing it more and more. And

80
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:53,040
in an away game like this, the use of

81
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,200
Yarez having EZ with him was absolutely

82
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,920
huge in this game, I thought, and it led

83
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,319
to them having a lot more access into

84
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,680
central areas, but also you had someone

85
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,720
who could get you up the pitch because

86
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,560
in transition, it was one where it did a

87
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,959
lot of good for Arsenal and I thought

88
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,200
Joz in particular really really sort of

89
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,879
stood out for me. So this is Arsenal

90
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,800
kind of when they uh you know were

91
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,959
defending and Newcastle kind of going

92
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,400
for it a little bit here and the ability

93
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:24,239
for Yarez to be able to make that run be

94
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,640
that backboard but both drive in behind

95
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,440
into the channels or also be a target

96
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:32,080
man. I thought that is it's so basic and

97
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,239
traditional but it's so useful but it is

98
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,040
pointless if he is all on his own. But

99
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,200
having Ez as that sort of central

100
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,840
attacking midfielder or second striker,

101
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,599
let's say, and he was told to sort of

102
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,319
get up there and help him and be in and

103
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:48,560
around him, it led to so many great

104
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:51,680
moments. Let me show you exactly what I

105
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,200
mean, because

106
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,480
this is let's go through it because

107
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,599
there's loads here and I think there's

108
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,640
good bits and there's bad bits and

109
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,640
that's what I want to get into it with

110
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,879
Yarez's performance here because him

111
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,560
being that target man, this is a break

112
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:05,360
that I think Tim has been able to play

113
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:08,080
the ball to him. He's that backboard. He

114
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,519
takes center backs out out of position.

115
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,280
But if you don't have someone in this

116
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,480
area here, it's all a little bit

117
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,159
redundant because you're not really

118
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,000
hurting the opposition. But in this

119
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,160
moment here, you see one little pass and

120
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,079
it makes a huge difference in terms of

121
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,919
attacking the game and hurting the

122
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,440
opposition because as you can see here,

123
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:24,960
so this is him getting on the ball,

124
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,560
laying it off. Then you got someone as

125
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,160
brilliant as Sack is able to drive and

126
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,199
get into those central areas. And the

127
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:34,320
crucial thing here is having that second

128
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:36,160
striker. Now EZ is not going to, you

129
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,600
know, be a target man, right? That's not

130
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,840
what he's about. But the important thing

131
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,280
is, you know, the center back is now

132
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,880
kind of redundant because he's being

133
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:49,120
pinned. So now you've actually got

134
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:52,320
one, two, three, four against in truth

135
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,080
one, two. So it was really, really

136
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,240
useful having Yarez in those

137
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,720
transitional moments to help you move up

138
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,560
the pitch. Can Havitz do this? Yeah,

139
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,919
Havtz can do this. Absolutely. And I

140
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,919
think there is going to be that debate.

141
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,600
And so that leads to a fantastic moment

142
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,840
where they're able to get through the

143
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,440
center of teams quickly. We know how

144
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,600
they can have control possession and

145
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,520
they did often in this game. But I think

146
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,919
on another day maybe against a different

147
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,160
team that doesn't defend as well as this

148
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,600
or if it kind of fools your way, you're

149
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,800
in a much better position. And there

150
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,039
were moments throughout the game. This

151
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,199
is a moment where Yres can maybe go to

152
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,440
EZ maybe can he open up his body and

153
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,520
turn and go to Trussard who's on his way

154
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,759
as well. But understandably, Saka is the

155
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,039
aside here, so he doesn't want to do it.

156
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,479
But it's not the end of the world. Him

157
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,320
being that backboard allows him to play

158
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,680
the ball quickly. And I think he's

159
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,280
getting to grips with the physicality

160
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,919
here. And again, having a player that

161
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,759
can spin and drive with the intensity

162
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,639
that he's able to. One thing I would

163
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:49,440
say, can he show a little bit more

164
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:52,320
nuance at times? Can he bend that run

165
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:55,120
and be the other side of the center back

166
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,320
here? I think that could have I mean I

167
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,600
guess the one that thing that's good

168
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,800
about being this side is that you're

169
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,919
kind of keeping that center back honest

170
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,160
so he doesn't cut across. So maybe it's

171
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,600
a smart move but if he does go across

172
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,919
then maybe he can get the ball himself

173
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,080
and he's in because by the end of it

174
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,759
Saka now has to go down that side and

175
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,960
he's not able to pull the ball back.

176
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,400
Would there have been a bit different

177
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,960
way of doing that where you're able to

178
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,360
get into that area of the pitch. These

179
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,520
are the little things that Yokarez cuz

180
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,400
there are moments. It's not perfect, but

181
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:27,360
it is getting better. There are shoots

182
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:30,160
of hope here for Yarez. Yes, he's a

183
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,919
little bit clunky,

184
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,800
a bit cumbersome, but I think that's

185
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,919
what's going to come with him. But

186
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,800
there's going to be moments where you

187
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:38,080
absolutely love every second of it. Now,

188
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,800
the goals are interesting because I

189
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,720
think there's a set piece setup that

190
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,520
we're going to see more and more. And

191
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,240
what it is is this. So you saw it for

192
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:51,039
both first goals for both teams. This is

193
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,880
the corner. Plays it off here. And the

194
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:55,360
important thing is is getting into this

195
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,520
area here because from here you can put

196
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,400
a cross in

197
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,240
and you can go towards that back post.

198
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,319
Tell another one. Just go straight to

199
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,919
that back post. And by hitting that back

200
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,759
post, if everyone misses the ball,

201
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:10,319
that's fine. But what could be even

202
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,720
better to optimize it is can you get all

203
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:15,120
your big boys in a row here? And that's

204
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,960
exactly what they did so fantastically

205
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,240
for the goal Newcastle, but it's

206
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,759
something that Arsenal ended up doing

207
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,960
themselves as well. So here you go. You

208
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:24,639
can see the cross coming in here. Okay,

209
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,039
maybe it's not perfectly in that back

210
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,319
line, but one where David Rya maybe

211
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,639
can't come and get it, which is

212
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,599
important here, but as you can see, big

213
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:36,160
man, big man, big man, big man. Four big

214
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,360
mans in a lovely diagonal line, and it

215
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,680
means that they can go and get on the

216
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,440
ball that and it's in line with the

217
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,800
flight of that cross. I thought that was

218
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,080
a really really clever setup and

219
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,160
Voltomard himself spoke about how that

220
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,840
had been set up in training. This is the

221
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,800
other side of Jockarez I want to touch

222
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:55,680
on because this is one where there's a

223
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,400
lack of kind of nuance to his dribbling.

224
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,000
I think at times at no point during this

225
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,360
passage of play and I think a lot of

226
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,199
people might analyze this does he make

227
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,240
you think he's going this way at all or

228
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,840
truly slow you down to burst away? I

229
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,199
mean, has he got that outrageous burst

230
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,639
that he can get away from these big

231
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,240
center center backs because he's a sort

232
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,319
of big center back himself in terms of

233
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,479
his profile or has he got that

234
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,080
blistering pace just to go? The problem

235
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,759
he has here is I think he gets caught up

236
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,000
a little bit where he kind of goes away

237
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,520
right and so the center back's

238
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,599
completely in control then he trying to

239
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,160
cut tries to cut back for a second then

240
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:32,159
burst away but all the while I think we

241
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:36,159
know that he's kind of staying on at

242
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:37,839
that right side he goes he's trying but

243
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:41,039
it's not totally fluent and he kind of

244
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,800
takes away all of his passing options by

245
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,000
going down to that side and it makes it

246
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,519
easier for the goalkeeper as well to

247
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
sort of cut down the angle if he was

248
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:51,519
even able to get that yard in the and he

249
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,519
tries to chop back um onto his left

250
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,360
foot, but Malik Chow by this point

251
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,640
absolutely knows what he's doing. Knows

252
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,240
he needs to come back cuz he's not going

253
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,560
to go around the side. And so that's the

254
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:04,000
kind of the other side of of Jockarez in

255
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:06,880
terms of him and his kind of what's the

256
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,519
word just the sort of granular subtle

257
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,680
aspects to him as a player. What I

258
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,279
really liked and again go back to that

259
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:17,200
tactics board. You can see exactly what

260
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:20,080
we're talking about now is

261
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,120
just a lot more central. This will be

262
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,320
nice a minute. Let's do a little

263
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:27,200
diamond. Lot more central kind of uh

264
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:30,640
occupancy, right? If you think of that

265
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,399
line of of Newcastle getting inside it

266
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,000
and you've got players like Declan Rice

267
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,680
who are happy to play that ball forward,

268
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,160
like Zubmeni are happy to play that

269
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,640
forward. This is going to work really,

270
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,080
really well for Arsenal and this is the

271
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,120
next iteration. I think it's going to be

272
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,120
really interesting. We'll get on to

273
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,519
Odgaard's role here cuz Odgaard's role

274
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,600
in this game could be kind of the future

275
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,440
of his role in this team. Arsenal fans

276
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,360
been gasping for this. Play it into that

277
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,360
central area. I mean on this occasion

278
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,519
it's Timber there, but it's interesting

279
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,600
that at different moments Saka was there

280
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:02,399
as well, right? So he plays in here,

281
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,320
pops it off, plays it in to Yokarez.

282
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,600
This is all nice stuff. Yes, it's a

283
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,440
little bit uh clunky at the moment, but

284
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,959
it's coming. He actually does well to

285
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,320
get his feet out and then the defender

286
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,160
does really well to get back to him. And

287
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,360
if he was able to play that pass, then

288
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,959
Ez would have gone here. He would have

289
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,640
played it to Saka and would have been in

290
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,920
business. Saka could have made this

291
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,519
little run here. But I think

292
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,839
understandably thinks Yok is going to

293
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,640
get the ball to Ezer. That will be the

294
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,880
thing for Yokas. Can he play quicker? I

295
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,360
think he can once he knows everything

296
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,560
that's going on. It's a really good um

297
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,519
it's really good tackle by the end of

298
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,839
it. This is what we're talking about

299
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,000
with Sacka. Far more central here.

300
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,240
Trussard far more central. We've still

301
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,920
got that kind of diamond there which is

302
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,160
really really nice. I think away from

303
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,880
home because I think we know that this

304
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,720
team can recycle, can do the horseshoe

305
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,120
blah blah blah, but we're bored of it

306
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,560
and teams have figured it out. So to

307
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,880
have them concerned about what's going

308
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,040
on in central areas is really important

309
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,200
here. bouncing off. Esa doesn't actually

310
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,880
do very well with it in in the end. But

311
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,040
again, it's good play and it's the

312
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,959
ability to move the ball quickly and

313
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,200
move the ball forward in transition as

314
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:09,279
opposed to slowly working up the pitch.

315
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,040
And so there's so many positives here I

316
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,600
think from Yokarez and I think on

317
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,519
another day it does work out for him

318
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,240
much better. But this team in terms of

319
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:21,040
central access is so much better. Here's

320
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,519
a great example of it. EZ able to take

321
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,040
players out of the game and Zubendy

322
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,160
wanting to play the ball forward. But

323
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,560
just as importantly, zone bloody 14.

324
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,640
Yummy, yummy, yummy. Doing things,

325
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,720
taking players out of the game in zone

326
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:38,320
14. This is a moment where the ball

327
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,680
makes its way across to EZ and he's able

328
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,880
to take someone out of the game because

329
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,480
that is just what he does. Exactly that.

330
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,240
Takes someone out of the game and now

331
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,279
all of a sudden you got so many players

332
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,720
in such a like would you want you would

333
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,560
you'd want all those players there,

334
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,120
wouldn't you? And your two center backs.

335
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:58,880
It's amazing. This is such a dominant

336
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,399
team in terms of how they own the game

337
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,560
because they trust in these two center

338
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:05,600
backs. Look at all that space in behind.

339
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,519
I don't think I've ever seen a team as

340
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,680
confident in their two center backs as

341
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,279
this Arsenal team is. And so there is an

342
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,320
element of risk going backwards, but it

343
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:16,800
doesn't feel like that because of those

344
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,639
two center backs. But EZ attacking the

345
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,800
game, attacking within zone 14,

346
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:23,279
affecting the game. Zubamey with that

347
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,680
beautiful pass that he's able to loop

348
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:28,240
over and you've got all these players in

349
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,240
one little area like on another day you

350
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,399
get yourself a goal from it. So there

351
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,160
there were good elements of play this

352
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,839
moment where Yarez had a little slip.

353
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,279
Can his touch be better there? I think

354
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,040
this is just going to be part and parcel

355
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:42,000
of it. But if you go before that moment

356
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:45,120
in time again some of the nice stuff,

357
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,279
nice straight forward pass, no messing

358
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,880
pass into him, one touch and they're on

359
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:51,519
their way. And that again is the whole

360
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:54,160
reason why you want these two close

361
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:57,600
together. One touch into a he's on the

362
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:59,760
way. And again on another day, this is a

363
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:03,279
superb bit of defending. Amazing block.

364
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:05,360
Check this out. This is how it ended up

365
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,200
and it was amazing.

366
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,160
But it ends up like that. And the goal

367
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,959
comes the first goal comes from a corner

368
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:15,440
that Declan Rice wins. But he starts

369
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:18,160
here.

370
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,000
It ends up with him up here and Odegaard

371
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:23,279
is essentially on his own and you've

372
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,560
just got these three

373
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:28,240
as your sort of base. Now, first of all,

374
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,519
I thought Odigard looked really, really

375
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,120
comfortable in this position. I thought

376
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,720
he looked great. You know, with

377
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,480
everything in front of him, I think he's

378
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,680
far more comfortable. And when you think

379
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,600
of this double pivot

380
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,680
of of sorts that you see with Zubame

381
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,440
Mendy and Rice,

382
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,839
Zubamedi is happy to sort of wiggle

383
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,200
forward if he needs to. Odigard to a

384
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,920
point, but I think he doesn't actually

385
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,760
come out. But Declan Rice is happy to go

386
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,360
as well because he's got that drive in

387
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,800
him.

388
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,480
And I thought this worked really, really

389
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,760
well. And again, it's kind of it's a

390
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:02,560
risky situation, but it led to players

391
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:05,839
in those central areas in behind that

392
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:08,959
line of of Newcastle. And I thought it

393
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:12,399
was really really impressive stuff. Um,

394
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:14,560
and it leads to the goal. No shame. And

395
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,560
this is the thing like he the risks that

396
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,720
he was taking on this occasion I thought

397
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,480
were really really smart but it was part

398
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,800
of the attitude as well. So first of all

399
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,680
three players central area behind that

400
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:28,160
Newcastle line you know risk in terms of

401
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,079
Odigard being there and the goal comes

402
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,160
from this

403
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:35,040
move on one more Declar Rice. This is

404
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,399
sort prior to it where Odgaard gets the

405
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,760
ball. You've got your two center backs

406
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,240
here as we was talking about and Declar

407
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:43,040
Rice on his bike

408
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,320
and the goal comes from that. And what

409
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,360
was really interesting about the goal

410
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:50,320
was that the same idea as the first goal

411
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:53,680
for Newcastle was in place. This desire

412
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:56,000
to get the ball in a new zone here which

413
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,120
we've seen sort of several times you

414
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,040
know over the years I think with Man

415
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,880
City have been big on it Brenford have

416
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,160
been big on it. getting into this area

417
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,920
of the pitch. I think we're going to see

418
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,240
this more and more make short corners.

419
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,079
People trying to work their way to this

420
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,320
area here where they can put that cross

421
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:12,160
in and get that diagonal line to give

422
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,920
yourself a chance. And that's what kind

423
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,839
of comes. Moreno of course scores the

424
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,920
header in the end into this back corner,

425
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,680
but you got Celiba on his way into that

426
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,560
area as well. Jockz is maybe like a

427
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,720
little a second later. Ez, you've got a

428
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,240
whole line of people there. It's really

429
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,000
really not I mean it's it's something

430
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,920
that we've seen for a while but you see

431
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,399
things kind of become outrageously

432
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,880
prominent. I could see this becoming

433
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,880
outrageously prominent. So better from

434
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,639
Jockarez. I like the shape in

435
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,480
transition. They're still controlling

436
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,199
possession like they have done before.

437
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,440
Odigard maybe in a new role. Declin Rice

438
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:47,440
playing outrageously well. The back two

439
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,399
being sensational in that second half.

440
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,720
Gabrielle being just outrageously elite.

441
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,040
It is all those elements are coming

442
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,600
together.

443
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:00,160
And that win at St. James's Park has

444
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,600
been I mean it's been lacking hasn't it?

445
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,399
You know if you think of the year where

446
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,399
you were supposed to get in the

447
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,839
Champions League or over the last few

448
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:09,199
years they've really really struggled at

449
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:12,639
St. James's Park. So to get that win in

450
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:15,680
the last minute by being on the front

451
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:18,079
foot and attacking but also with an

452
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,160
element of control I guess as well. I

453
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:22,959
thought it was absolutely enormous. And

454
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,959
I think you've got two teams here in

455
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,480
Liverpool and Arsenal that are both

456
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,720
sensational and will dominate a lot of

457
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,079
games and score a lot of late goals, but

458
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,440
this is going to go down to the wire and

459
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:34,480
there's going to be games where

460
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,920
Liverpool kind of can overpower their

461
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,240
opposition maybe with a bit of

462
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,920
individuality, but the wholehearted

463
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,000
chemistry of that team is still

464
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,600
building. I think you can see that for

465
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,040
Arsenal, there's an element of

466
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,440
chemistry. One question I would chuck

467
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,519
out to you guys, answer this for me. The

468
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,959
two fullbacks, how do you feel about

469
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,120
those two? That was one question I kind

470
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:55,519
of had to myself. Look, defensively,

471
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,560
sensational. The work rate of the two

472
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:00,079
absolutely sensational as well. But from

473
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,000
an attacking point of view, are they

474
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:04,240
going to get and does it even matter?

475
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,240
Are they going to get you enough goals

476
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,679
and assists?

477
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,280
I don't I don't want to have a go at

478
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,439
either of their performances because why

479
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,439
would you? Like, you know, that's silly.

480
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:16,079
And I really love Caluri and his

481
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,360
dynamism and Timber just I mean, he's a

482
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,199
machine.

483
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,199
and and fantastic on the ball, but he

484
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,120
does naturally want to come back. He

485
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,720
doesn't wholeheartedly want to sort of

486
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,640
drive and dribble with the ball like a

487
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,559
Friong would or like when you think of

488
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,039
those top teams, their ability to go and

489
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,960
win the game for you. That's the thing I

490
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,240
would say about this team. The team is

491
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,320
sensational. They're not going to

492
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,600
concede many goals, but are they going

493
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,000
to score enough goals? I don't think

494
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,679
that is wholeheartedly going to go away,

495
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,400
but I think in transition, you've got

496
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:46,400
something now here where these two can

497
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,400
break for you and you can really hurt an

498
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,080
opposition.

499
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,160
Sorry, I just pressed something there.

500
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,080
By the way, this tactics board is

501
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,640
available. Link is in the description if

502
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,720
you want to have a go. Um, so yeah, I

503
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,320
think it's exciting times. I think this

504
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,640
title race is going to go down to the

505
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,799
wire, but I think this was so much so

506
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,320
much bigger a victory than people

507
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:09,120
thought. Let me know your thoughts in

508
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,120
the comments below.
