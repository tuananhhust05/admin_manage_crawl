00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
Imagine a game of baseball where a

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:07,040
pitcher doesn't allow any batter to even

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,440
reach first base once. This is what

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,200
baseball calls the perfect game. It's

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,040
incredibly difficult, but it's not

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,200
impossible. Since the beginning of Major

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,920
League Baseball in 1876, there have only

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,439
been 24 official perfect games. The

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,520
first was technically thrown by Lee

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,519
Richmond in 1880, but at that time,

11
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,920
pitchers could only bowl underarm and

12
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,240
the pitching distance was only 45 ft as

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,240
opposed to the 60 ft and 6 in today.

14
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,239
that was referred to in a newspaper as

15
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,600
quote the most wonderful game on record.

16
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:35,680
But the term perfect game didn't

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,480
actually come into use until Addy Joss

18
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,239
threw the fourth one in 1908. No player

19
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,239
has ever managed it twice, but Ron

20
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,960
Hassie was the catcher for Len Barker

21
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,360
and Dennis Martinez's games in 1981 and

22
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,960
91, respectively. Only one player has

23
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,320
managed a perfect game during the World

24
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,600
Series, and that was the New York

25
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,719
Yankees Don Lson in 1956. And the only

26
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,559
player to throw one since the

27
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,760
introduction of a pitch clock is Domingo

28
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,760
Hermon in 2023.
