Right then people, welcome back to the

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,160
rip effect with me and this week's

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,759
guest, the wonderful Culture Cams, who's

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,200
killing it on YouTube. If you've not

00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,280
seen one of his videos, just click on

6
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,200
one and then you will see lots of them

7
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,040
and they will all nourish you with

8
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,640
footballing goodness.

9
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,480
>> Yeah, good promo.

10
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,840
>> Perfect promo. Perfect.

11
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,240
>> Uh, thanks for coming in, mate. We've

12
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,240
done a lovely juicy podcast on Man

13
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,080
United and and now we're going to have a

14
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,240
look at the Premier League summer

15
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,519
signing so far. So, one thing just to

16
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,480
not be hypocrites from the first

17
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,239
podcast, this is uh we've got some

18
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,920
different tiers here. Now, the tiers for

19
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,800
this are huge, huge potential, will come

20
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,360
good,

21
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:44,239
>> not feeling it, why refund.

22
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,760
>> Okay, cool.

23
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,440
>> Probably a bit too many. I might get rid

24
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,280
of one of them. We'll figure it out.

25
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,239
>> But the thing to remember here is it is

26
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,920
early days, but we're going to have a

27
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,079
nuance discussion and that's why you

28
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,559
guys are here. So, thank you for joining

29
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,320
us in this room virtually

30
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,000
>> and uh we're going to get into it. So,

31
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,000
because there are a lot of new signings

32
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,280
and they are all finding their feet,

33
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,680
some are finding their feet quicker than

34
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,520
others, but I think what's great is and

35
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,880
I know you and Le are big on the eye

36
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,000
test. I think I'm becoming I'm getting

37
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,439
bigger and bigger on the eye test.

38
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
>> Yeah. Welcome. I know.

39
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,280
>> Welcome. I think I'm kind of like I was

40
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,520
had a good discussion with someone about

41
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,360
this actually last week about

42
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,280
>> the balance between the two

43
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:25,119
>> and because I think people that turn

44
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,640
away from stats um are kind of missing

45
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,960
the point a little bit. The point of

46
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,640
stats is to you should see something

47
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,560
then you should be able to go I reckon

48
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,680
this stat and you find the stat and you

49
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,040
go ah

50
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,400
>> not the other way around. I think a lot

51
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,560
of people do it the other way around.

52
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,520
>> Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, the stats. So, the

53
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,640
stats are going to be pretty limited

54
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,759
here because it's early data set, but

55
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,799
that's part of the fun in terms of what

56
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,600
where we feel like they're kind of

57
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,159
going.

58
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,240
>> Let's start off with uh and we'll run

59
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,680
through as many as we can. Martin Zuber

60
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,759
Mendy

61
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,119
>> 26 come through the door. Seven

62
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:57,920
appearances, two goals, no assist. Um,

63
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,840
here's a ripple effect for you of uh

64
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,719
ripple effect of this season has seen

65
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,880
less need for Miles Lewis Skelly for

66
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:08,399
buildup purposes because you got Zubie

67
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:11,200
in there making Califury more important

68
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,520
and ahead of him in the pecking order.

69
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,760
Yeah.

70
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,760
>> So, let's let's touch on Zubi first.

71
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,599
Comes through the door.

72
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,480
>> He's a bit of me as a player. I'll be

73
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,239
honest.

74
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,160
>> Yeah. to your point on the previous

75
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,400
podcast, that first game against Man

76
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,879
United, I I think that hit him like a

77
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,560
train.

78
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,920
>> Yeah, it did.

79
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,360
>> He was like,

80
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,400
>> "What is this?" Like, "Why does the ball

81
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,040
keep going over my head?"

82
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,040
>> Yeah.

83
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,319
>> Um like a real different planet for him.

84
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,280
But I I feel like he's I think he will

85
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,000
be huge for them.

86
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,440
>> Huge.

87
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,680
>> I do.

88
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,680
>> I think

89
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,959
Let's get rid of huge potential. Let's

90
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,760
get that. Let's just do You're going to

91
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,160
do huge.

92
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,400
>> Okay. or will come good. So, I think it

93
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,400
will be huge for them. I think the way

94
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,840
Arteta is setting up with having Declan

95
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,360
Rice kind of with him a little bit at

96
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,040
times, it means that like different

97
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,160
people can like bomb on a little bit.

98
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,760
That's the one thing I've been a bit

99
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,080
quite impressed with him is that I

100
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,360
thought he I think we just sit there.

101
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,120
>> Yeah, I thought that too. But he's

102
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,879
actually going even in buildup. Declan

103
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,400
Rice is sometimes starting the buildup

104
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,319
and I I thought it was always going to

105
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,080
be um Zuba Meny picking up the ball from

106
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,360
the back four. So sometimes I see him

107
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,040
when they in possession, he's actually

108
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,040
higher up than Declan Rice, which is

109
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,400
quite quite interesting. It's not a

110
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,879
development that I thought was going to

111
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,400
happen.

112
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,800
>> I'm getting involved. You're not sure.

113
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:30,239
>> Yeah, I'm not too sure with Zubeni, you

114
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:33,040
know, like I'm not a fan of of um flimsy

115
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,560
defensive midfielders. Not really my

116
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,120
thing, you know what I mean? Unless

117
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,040
you're like special special. But

118
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,000
>> so with him, I'm your defensive

119
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,319
midfielder.

120
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,799
>> Yeah.

121
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,000
>> So are you are you an enforcer? me I get

122
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,440
about you know what I mean I'm quite

123
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,400
lazy though I'll be honest right I'm

124
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,840
quite lazy but I've got physical

125
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,920
strength you know I mean I got power

126
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,360
that's the thing I got power about me so

127
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,400
>> with me I'm not really a big fan of it

128
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,760
and I think

129
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,159
>> if you are going to be that

130
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,599
>> see I don't have power I think that's

131
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,239
the difference so smart he's so clever

132
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,560
he reads

133
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,480
>> the thing is like I look at him and I do

134
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,480
think yeah he reads the game and stuff

135
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,439
but I think if you are going to be like

136
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:13,120
a a flimsier type let me say what I say

137
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:15,280
is I see him

138
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,560
at a similar level to what Georgino

139
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,120
achieved.

140
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,600
>> Really?

141
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,239
>> Yeah.

142
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,880
>> Interesting.

143
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:23,600
>> And that what is that? That's good.

144
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,520
Georgino was a good player, but

145
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,919
>> is it wasn't amazing.

146
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,840
>> Yeah.

147
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,000
>> That's how I kind of see Zub Mendy for

148
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,120
me.

149
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
>> I get what you're saying.

150
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,560
>> Like,

151
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,479
>> but even even Georgino I thought had a

152
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,720
it's early. It's very early by the way,

153
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,919
but Georgino had this kind of give me

154
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,400
the ball

155
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:43,440
>> about him. Zu Mendi. It could be by um

156
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,520
instruction, but it's not that right

157
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,520
now. But I think he will come good. I'm

158
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,320
not going to say poor signing or

159
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,120
anything like that, but I wouldn't say

160
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,680
huge.

161
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,400
>> Okay.

162
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,720
>> I still think Declan Rice's importance

163
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,280
is going to be far greater.

164
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,440
>> I just think, and again, this is

165
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,880
probably leaning on me in terms of like

166
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,080
the player that you wish you were.

167
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:08,080
>> Mhm. I love players that can see a pass

168
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,680
that no one else can see and then they

169
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,320
do that one and you go, "Oh,

170
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,440
>> yeah." Yeah.

171
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,800
>> Um and I think

172
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,720
>> like Declan Rice was getting I thought

173
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,280
Dean Rice was unbelievable in the last

174
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,199
game. Yeah.

175
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,120
>> And he's often unbelievable. So I kind

176
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,560
of like let it go. I don't really

177
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,680
understand any kind of critique of him

178
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,960
really cuz I just think he's brilliant

179
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,880
because Skoles had a go at him the other

180
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,560
day saying he's like he could be so much

181
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,919
better but he just does unnecessary

182
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,320
things. I'm like I mean I'm not gonna

183
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:34,720
argue with Skoles but I kind of

184
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,479
>> Yeah. I didn't I thought that was a bit

185
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,639
funny cuz the way he like the way he

186
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,360
gets about the pitch incredible man.

187
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,520
>> He's so complete.

188
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,400
>> It's like a modern

189
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,720
keen in a way.

190
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,199
>> Yeah.

191
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,600
>> You know what I mean?

192
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:49,520
>> But he played like he played a a pass.

193
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,639
He played a pass into EZ. Um and people

194
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,120
got a bit cra I thought they were going

195
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,240
a bit mad about the pass cuz it was

196
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,880
quite a simple pass. Um, but I think

197
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,240
Zubendi does that all the time and I

198
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,800
don't think people that will become like

199
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,560
a regular like yeah we know that about

200
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,759
him. So he might get kind of like

201
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,199
forgotten a little bit. I think he plays

202
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,840
the ball forward a bit more than Geor

203
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,319
personally.

204
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,280
>> You think so?

205
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,199
>> I think Georgie is a bit like

206
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,720
>> he was more metronomic give me the ball

207
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,520
and go yeah I get what you're saying. I

208
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,400
get I can hear that.

209
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,600
>> That's okay. We can disagree.

210
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,400
>> Yeah. I will come good.

211
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,120
>> Will come good. Okay.

212
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,720
>> Yes.

213
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,919
>> Well remembered. Uh sticking with

214
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,600
Arsenal. We'll work through them. Uh

215
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,400
Joarez.

216
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,160
>> Yarez.

217
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,120
>> How are you feeling about him? Not

218
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,919
feeling it.

219
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,280
>> You're not feeling it?

220
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,960
>> I'm not feeling it. I'll be honest with

221
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,759
you. I'm not feeling it.

222
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,360
>> I get that.

223
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:35,600
>> I'm not feeling it with Yarez. I I Your

224
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,120
for me, I I looked at him in in Portugal

225
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,880
and

226
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,240
I was genuinely looking at him and I was

227
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,280
like, what is his outstanding thing that

228
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,800
I think if he comes to the Premier

229
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,000
League, it's just going to easily

230
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,120
translate. And I didn't see it. And a

231
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,400
lot of people saying, "Well, Harland

232
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,600
played in this league." But and I'm

233
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,759
like, Harland is genuinely a physical

234
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:59,199
freak. Like his spee's like a physical

235
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:02,000
specimen. Like his genetic athleticism

236
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:04,400
is unreal. So that will translate. And

237
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
honestly, people may laugh because he

238
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,080
became kind of a meme or whatever, but

239
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,680
Darwin Nunez, I looked at him in

240
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,360
Portugal and I said, "Oh, what you have

241
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,960
can translate to the Premier League." I

242
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,479
would have never anticipated how bad he

243
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:19,039
was at at finishing. But that speed,

244
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:22,080
that athleticism, it still actually got

245
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:24,400
him pretty far at Liverpool. He just

246
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,560
couldn't finish it. Like he was a chance

247
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,720
magnet. And I thought to myself, but

248
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,240
Yarez, yeah, I know he's running past

249
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,880
these players, but he doesn't strike me

250
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,440
as the as the pestest athlete. He

251
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,720
doesn't strike me as the fastest guy.

252
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,759
And I was like, okay, how's it going to

253
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,400
translate? And I'm looking at him at

254
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,840
Arsenal. And I think any base level

255
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,919
striker for Arsenal should score about

256
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,759
15 goals. I think that Kai Havitz did

257
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:48,800
it. Jesus would have did it if he stayed

258
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,319
fit. Base level will be about 15 goals.

259
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,000
But do I look at him and think to

260
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,280
myself, I think he'll get that.

261
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
>> But do I look at him and I think to

262
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,440
myself,

263
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,960
>> oh, you're going to be Arsenal striker

264
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,720
for the next three years and they're

265
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:02,080
going to be relying on you to be scoring

266
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:04,560
20 plus and putting up crazy numbers.

267
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:08,560
No. And now look at he was he was he

268
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,639
just won the um J Müller award. He'll

269
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:14,720
never get that Arsenal. He'll never ever

270
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:16,639
get the the that level at Arsenal.

271
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,240
>> I don't think he's a great player, but I

272
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,720
think he will score goals. I look at his

273
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,479
touch sometimes. I look at

274
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,080
>> the way he occupies center halfs and I'm

275
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,440
like

276
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,599
not really my type of player. I'll be

277
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,199
honest.

278
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,360
>> He needs to get cuter. He really does

279
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:33,120
need to get cuter because I think he

280
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,880
what is interesting I would put him in

281
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,560
>> I get why you're not feeling it. I would

282
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,519
put it in will come good. Okay.

283
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,880
>> But but how good? Like I would say like

284
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,519
I think you'll get 15 easy, right? I

285
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,279
think so too

286
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,040
>> because I think currently he's like this

287
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,920
battering ram, right? And different

288
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,600
center backs are are like kind of walls

289
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,120
>> and with the right one you could just

290
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,920
you can get push through it.

291
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,000
>> Yeah.

292
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,399
>> When you see him against,

293
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,080
>> you know, the lit and

294
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,600
>> some of these different guys, yeah, they

295
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,120
seem to be able to like deal with them

296
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,440
pretty easily, right?

297
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,760
>> Because there's no subtlety to it, you

298
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,360
know? It's like you fight fire with fire

299
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,920
and you should be you should be all

300
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,320
right.

301
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,600
>> I think against the other teams

302
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,720
>> where you don't need that same kind of

303
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,080
subtlety,

304
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,120
>> I think you'll score a lot of goals. And

305
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,640
that's what I said a couple of weeks

306
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,000
ago. So far, I guess it's true. It feels

307
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,279
like and I thought he had a little bit a

308
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,880
few unfortunate moments against

309
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,720
Newcastle, but there's one moment where

310
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:28,000
he gets kind of put through and he has

311
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,519
to run against Malik Chow and as he's

312
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,040
driving, he doesn't do anything

313
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:34,080
outrageously wrong, but you you know,

314
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,800
it's so comfortable.

315
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,360
>> Yeah. Yeah.

316
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,519
>> It's so comfortable. And so he needs to

317
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,880
progress and he needs to develop even at

318
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,800
kind of this age. And I think that was a

319
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,440
debate with him and Sesho was that you

320
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,560
felt like Sesko's got more like room to

321
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,080
progress

322
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,360
>> and maybe more like

323
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:53,120
>> natural raw bits to him whereas Joarez

324
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,320
is going to be that battering now in

325
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,000
terms of getting you where you want to

326
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,120
be which is to win the league.

327
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,200
>> I think a lot of points that they

328
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,760
dropped last year was

329
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,839
>> was down to not conceding goals, it was

330
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,040
down to scoring goals. So I think in

331
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,279
those other games

332
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,880
>> Yeah. But the thing is is it going to be

333
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,800
like that though? Is it necessarily

334
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,120
like, you know, is the game so black and

335
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,240
white that it's like, oh, last season we

336
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,160
didn't beat the little teams, but we

337
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,279
were good against the big teams. So, at

338
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,720
Yakarez, he's just going to score

339
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,920
against all the little teams and then

340
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,360
we're going to do the same thing we did

341
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,360
against all the big teams, and that

342
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,839
means we win the title. That seems a bit

343
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,279
too

344
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,120
>> Well, I think first of all, you got like

345
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,360
Havitz. Havitz is not just going to stop

346
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,760
playing. So, like you could bring him in

347
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,800
certain games. I also think we've kind

348
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,440
of seen it when people talk about the

349
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:38,959
handbrake and stuff like that.

350
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,560
I think I I think Arteta thinks that the

351
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:43,279
league will be won and lost on how you

352
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,320
get on against the other guys as much as

353
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,440
>> the games against Man City and

354
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,320
Liverpool. Those games are huge. Of

355
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,720
course they are. And if you can get the

356
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,680
win, great. If you don't lose, that's

357
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,360
that's pretty cool, too.

358
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,640
>> That was Fergie's mantra. Fergie

359
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,360
honestly did not care about the big

360
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,200
games the way we used to win leagues and

361
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,320
not beat the big teams a lot of times.

362
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,079
>> You'd beat everyone else.

363
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,519
>> Everyone else would beat. And maybe that

364
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,959
is what our test was thinking. Like

365
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,320
Bergie used to be like, "Yeah, go

366
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,320
especially away from home. just don't

367
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,040
lose. We don't lose away from home. He's

368
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,800
he's happy man cuz it's only

369
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,920
>> three four fixtures. Well, obviously

370
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,440
that stacks up, but

371
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,880
>> also I don't I don't think I always

372
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,880
think it's so more so than ever. I think

373
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,200
it's harder to win those other games

374
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,240
like those Bulma like uh like you you

375
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,959
know we were talking last one you got

376
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,800
Sunderland teams are quick. They got

377
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,399
physicality. They're good in transition.

378
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,240
They're organized. Teams have never been

379
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,000
more organized than this. Teams have

380
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,440
never been bigger than this. So then

381
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,519
you're making it a bit of a set piece

382
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,079
game. So that's a bit one thing for sure

383
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:38,320
is that Arsenal I still think even with

384
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:40,560
even if Yarez I don't think he's going

385
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,920
to flop but even if he did flop I think

386
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,240
Arsenal can still win the league in

387
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,959
spite of that. I do think they can you

388
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:49,760
know what I mean like he's got to be so

389
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:51,600
bad for him to have a real effect on

390
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:55,120
what I think Arsenal can do this season.

391
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:57,040
Yeah, I do. I feel that like that Lukaku

392
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,440
just like can't seem to score against

393
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,040
that I think that could be a tag for him

394
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,680
unless he can get a lot cuter a lot

395
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,839
quicker. Um but still he still

396
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,279
facilitates the team in different ways.

397
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,519
It just like eye test wise it doesn't

398
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:11,200
look great.

399
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,440
>> Uh you'd love him you'd love him in

400
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,839
midfield.

401
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,480
>> Ez I've spoken too much about EZ.

402
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,800
>> Yeah. Huge.

403
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,720
>> So So you tell me about do you you think

404
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,279
huge? huge if he's allowed to play in

405
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,920
the 10 on the left hand side. I've seen

406
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:28,240
as a for England on the left hand side.

407
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,639
We saw a little bit of it for Arsenal.

408
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,399
It's not his best role, man. It's not

409
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,320
his best role. You don't want like

410
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,959
you're trying to turn him into like a

411
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,560
one v one kind of player and as a

412
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,040
central dribbling like running in the

413
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,560
middle of the park. He's he's top three

414
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,760
in the league in my opinion. If you're

415
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,519
talking about getting the ball and

416
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,160
running through players in the middle of

417
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:50,000
the pitch, I look at as a Kuna's really

418
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,440
good at it as well. But you running

419
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,279
through people so underrated. That skill

420
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,320
as well is so difficult.

421
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:58,639
>> So underrated. And I think if he if they

422
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,320
can get him in that role, you know what

423
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,240
I mean? Like he moves the ball quicker

424
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,720
than Odegaard. He's more direct than

425
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,560
Odigard. He he runs past players better

426
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,800
than Odigard as well. Not this not to

427
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,880
disrespect Odard in any way, but I think

428
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,880
he excites people as well. You're

429
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,480
talking about low blocks, mid blocks.

430
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,000
When you play against low blocks and you

431
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,440
play against mid blocks,

432
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,399
>> you need someone that can carry the

433
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,399
ball.

434
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,480
>> Penetration is important, right? You

435
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,160
need someone that can commit you. If I

436
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,440
know Ez's on the ball,

437
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,800
>> you're going to have to go to him.

438
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,399
You're going to have to go towards him

439
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,959
and then he'll go past you and then all

440
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,959
of a sudden he's gone past you. Oh, Jo

441
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:35,120
has slipped that run. That's a goal for

442
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,240
him. But if you're got an ode who's not

443
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,920
going to do any of that, he's going to

444
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,519
pass it around. He said, that's how

445
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,920
teams just set themselves up. And I

446
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,200
think Arsenal kind of have a

447
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,720
>> little bit of a cheat code there with

448
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,800
him in the 10 in terms of playing

449
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,920
against these mid blocks and these low

450
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,839
blocks. So

451
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,920
>> I think it's a huge sign if he plays in

452
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,920
the 10 role. The left I'm just I'm

453
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,000
really hoping for his sake they don't

454
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,519
put him on the left hand side. Honestly

455
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
because Artet is not the type of manager

456
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,199
that's like play on the left but then oh

457
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,120
you're on the left but it's a free roll

458
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:05,920
off the left. It's not. It's you're on

459
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,279
the left. You know what I mean? So so I

460
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,120
want him to play in the 10 role.

461
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,320
>> I couldn't agree more. Yeah, I think I

462
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,600
said it with Le a couple of weeks ago

463
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:16,399
was like I could see him in that I liked

464
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,839
him on that right that is he's not right

465
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,199
sided 10 but he's actually what you saw

466
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,120
against Newcastle we actually he that

467
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,880
sort of second shadow striker so to the

468
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,839
point of Odigard with the famous mid

469
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,680
block when you haven't got the ball

470
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,040
where he becomes part of the two

471
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:31,040
>> as they can do that

472
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,880
>> and and he just he beats players because

473
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,199
me and Kai we've spotted it once and now

474
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,959
we can't we can't unsee it we're doing

475
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,959
we're gonna work on a video about it he

476
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,079
beats players is without touching the

477
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,519
ball. See

478
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,600
>> how mad that is?

479
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:46,079
>> Well, he's like not he's not like he's

480
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,120
not moving it moving it moving. It it's

481
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,360
>> that just glides in it.

482
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,320
>> It just glides past. It's so special.

483
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,760
>> And and he's a he's an massive you what

484
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,680
one of the things that Arsenal they were

485
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,680
genuinely probably top bottom three in

486
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,440
the league last season in terms of

487
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,560
transitions. And now a lot of people are

488
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,120
going to say, "Oh, we still scored

489
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,880
transition goals." I mean transition

490
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,240
goals will still count. booting the ball

491
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,440
long to sack

492
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,120
>> and then he brought the ball down

493
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,720
against Liverpool and then scored.

494
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,959
That's individual brilliance. But in

495
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,920
terms of like, you know, those counters

496
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,920
at their best, you remember when like

497
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,079
KDB will bring the ball forward,

498
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,800
Sterling's running off, Sane's run, you

499
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,480
know what I'm talking about,

500
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,480
transitions. Arsenal were really bad at

501
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,880
that in terms of turning defense into

502
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,160
attack quickly. I think EZ also helps

503
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,600
that. He's one of the best ball carriers

504
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,000
in the Premier League. Get him the ball

505
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:33,120
on a on a transition, everyone can just

506
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,040
go. Whereas again, touches, small

507
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,120
touches, he's not the power to keep

508
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,040
going and run and bring them forward.

509
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,480
So, I think with EZ in there,

510
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,079
>> it's it's massively going to help them

511
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,959
in that 10 roll, man. Honestly,

512
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,639
>> I agree. Huge been pretty consistent

513
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,160
with this one. I know like it's it's a

514
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,120
weird one for me with cuz it's like it's

515
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,759
the first time people going, "Well,

516
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,160
you're biased."

517
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,519
>> Yeah.

518
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,920
>> And I don't really get that much, but

519
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,920
I'm like I am, but I can still see and

520
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,959
you just for a reason. You said it for

521
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,120
me.

522
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,480
uh Keller to move over to a couple of

523
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,399
Brenford boys.

524
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,560
>> Keller I mean that's a good signing.

525
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,639
>> He's done well man. I think that's I

526
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:10,880
mean obviously pretty pricey to go

527
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:12,720
there. Um Fleckham was um pretty uh he

528
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,519
actually made money off Fleckenham go to

529
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,839
and Fleckenham was his uh he was really

530
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:20,880
he highly rated by Brenford. No one else

531
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,600
really spoke about it cuz up there with

532
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,480
like

533
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,279
>> all the save charts in Flecken was

534
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,600
always up there isn't it?

535
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:29,120
>> Yeah. And I always there's a my mate was

536
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,440
on and there's a forum called the

537
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,360
Griffin Park grapevine and they'll have

538
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,680
like who their man of the match is and

539
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,320
Flecken would like win it regular or be

540
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,240
right up there.

541
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,040
>> He was good. I think Kell is a really

542
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,560
good replacement.

543
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,000
>> Amazing replacement. I'd love to know

544
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,519
the contract and what the situation is

545
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,600
there. 26

546
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,680
>> come in obviously making saves from

547
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,920
penalties had a couple of like shaky

548
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,680
starts at the beginning of it but I

549
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,720
think that can't go wrong.

550
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,880
>> Yeah. Like even and I know this bit

551
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,160
disastrous if but the initial thinking

552
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,160
going into the season is obviously not

553
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,639
that you know you go down but if

554
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:05,360
something like that was to happen

555
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,559
that's a really good sellable asset.

556
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,280
>> Yeah he'll he'll move on he'll be back

557
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,120
in the Premier League.

558
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,799
>> Yeah I don't think I mean feels like

559
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,240
Brenford Brenford

560
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,640
>> you know better than I thought to be

561
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,319
fair.

562
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,120
>> They are I think they're going to be a

563
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,760
hard watch.

564
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:19,760
>> Yeah Keith Andrews he has you can see he

565
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,439
is a set piece coach in it. You can see

566
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,400
it. I mean, what's all these long

567
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,199
throws, bro?

568
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,679
>> It's everywhere. What?

569
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,199
>> Here's the stat. So, I I said this week,

570
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,520
we we make a short for the Premier

571
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:27,760
League.

572
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,360
>> Okay.

573
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,400
>> And I was like, we need to do a short on

574
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:34,559
long throws. And uh we found a stat on

575
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,240
it. Um and it was like

576
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,840
>> prior to this season, long in terms of

577
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,720
per game, how many long throws they

578
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,880
were,

579
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,799
>> it's generally like one point something.

580
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,520
>> It's now like nearly four.

581
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,200
>> Wow.

582
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,480
>> Yeah. Everyone's at it.

583
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,960
>> What do you think the reason for that is

584
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,520
though? cuz I actually always thought

585
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,679
set pieces are very underutilized in

586
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,480
football. I always I've always thought

587
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,760
that you know

588
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,320
>> do you know what the biggest thing is?

589
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,679
>> Yeah.

590
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,360
>> You can't be offside.

591
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,960
>> There we go. Launch that.

592
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,840
>> So if you think you know if you think of

593
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,919
a game of football the the pitch is as

594
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,039
big as the defenders decide to a point,

595
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,240
right? Because if they go they're

596
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,960
offside. Leave them

597
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,919
>> with a throw on. If they go you have to

598
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,280
go with them.

599
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:17,840
>> Yeah. So all of a sudden the ball is and

600
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,760
when you're throwing the ball you should

601
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,320
>> be pretty accurate with it, right? So

602
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,919
you're guaranteed the ball

603
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,200
>> going into the danger area

604
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,360
>> with loads of players there.

605
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,799
>> Yeah. Yeah. I think the throwins, look,

606
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,240
Tony P is probably sitting here

607
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,559
listening to this and thinking, "Oh,

608
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,080
well guys, I told you 10 like 20 years

609
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:37,039
ago." But but you know what it is,

610
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:41,039
right? I think yes, you should see

611
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:43,679
corners, throwins, free kicks. They are

612
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:45,039
the opportunity for you to do something

613
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,679
unopposed.

614
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:49,600
>> They should always be maximized. Always.

615
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:52,240
When I saw people criticizing set piece

616
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,919
again about Arsenal, I'm like, finally

617
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:57,520
there's a team that actually putting

618
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:59,840
priority to a free opportunity. Like it

619
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,840
doesn't make Yes. launch that long throw

620
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,679
into the box. It should be seen

621
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,120
>> as in a way another corner.

622
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,320
>> It it really should be like you

623
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,840
shouldn't want the ball to go out the

624
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,320
pitch. Soon we're going to see players

625
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,840
like like like you remember that famous

626
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,080
clip where against Stoke where the guy

627
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,720
kicked it out in for a corner instead of

628
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,520
a throwing.

629
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,480
>> Yeah.

630
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,679
>> We're probably going to get a lot more

631
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,600
of that soon. Like there's going to be

632
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,799
teams that like this team actually the

633
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,720
data tells us they're better from

634
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:24,960
throwings than corners kick the ball off

635
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,360
for a corner. Hey, I I remember QB

636
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,600
played Milwall and we had this uh they

637
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:32,400
had this guy this long throw

638
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,120
>> and it was like it's exhausting to watch

639
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,440
though

640
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:38,480
>> but when it's you it's just like

641
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:40,559
>> it's anywhere in that half

642
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,919
>> it's like he does this whoop and but

643
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,760
fortunately I mean we drew the game one

644
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:46,000
all but he got sent off

645
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,080
>> this guy we're like thank god for that

646
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,760
we got to deal with this like because

647
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:53,200
like you say with I think with thrones

648
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:54,720
in particular it's so unopposed And the

649
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,840
angle, it's not like you've got to whip

650
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,720
it on to it.

651
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,120
>> It's a straight.

652
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,919
>> It's straight. Yeah. Cuz if you if you

653
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,840
think this is the other thing I think

654
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,480
you'll see more and more and more, which

655
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,240
it has got more prominent, but I think

656
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,240
maybe with corners as well. You think of

657
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,679
the goal Arsenal's goal, Newcastle's

658
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,440
first goal, and the goal against

659
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,360
Everton, which came not from the initial

660
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,640
corner, but when it came back out, that

661
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,520
cross

662
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,919
>> on the corner of the penalty box. And

663
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:23,600
that more so than ever before like

664
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:26,640
you're having four, five, six foot two

665
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:28,080
plus guys in a diagonal line in line

666
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,520
with that back post. It all feels pretty

667
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,880
obvious but teams are really really

668
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,360
working towards that

669
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,360
>> and you saw like Volto um obviously say

670
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,159
Artic looks like Maria.

671
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,280
>> Um and yeah the goal was it Keem with a

672
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,039
good header as well. You're going to see

673
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,159
that more and more and more. Yeah. You

674
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,640
don't want it to be everything.

675
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,880
>> No you don't. You don't like you still I

676
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,120
don't want to see it from like I want to

677
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,720
see it from when it's like around the

678
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,200
boxish area. So let's say like the

679
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,120
corner to maybe like the 18 yd line or

680
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,039
something. Great. I don't want to see

681
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,600
teams just getting just over the halfway

682
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:01,120
line and just now all the defenders

683
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,720
going you now start launching it. That's

684
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,200
when the game's gone. That is when the

685
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,840
game's gone.

686
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,039
>> Uh Jordan Henderson 35year-old six

687
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,960
appearances.

688
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:11,280
>> You know I laughed at this signing.

689
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,039
>> Did you? I did laugh at it

690
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,159
>> about this because you know you with the

691
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,840
boys you're like

692
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:18,000
>> you know you're not backwards and coming

693
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,120
forwards you know you say go this is

694
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,159
this

695
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,360
>> and you have to eat a bit humble pie

696
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,080
which I like I think it's good that you

697
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,480
got that in you.

698
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,320
>> Yeah I mean cuz he schooled us he

699
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,760
actually schooled us like you know I was

700
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,159
doing a watch along for the game.

701
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,200
>> Yeah

702
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,320
>> and I was like

703
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,600
>> where is that available?

704
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,720
>> That's on my YouTube channel. That's on

705
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,080
my YouTube channel. So I was watching

706
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,120
the game. I was doing a watch along and

707
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:39,120
I was like I was like oh literally it's

708
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,120
like commentators curse. I was like,

709
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,640
"Come on, man. We got a game. We got We

710
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,400
got Jordan Henderson midfield."

711
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:47,360
Literally just clips it over the top

712
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,039
just as I said it. Bam. Thiago goal. So,

713
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,720
you know what? Credit to him cuz I

714
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,320
actually thought it's going to be like a

715
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,280
walking disaster. Like Jordan Henderson

716
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:58,159
coming in 35 years old. Keith Andrews in

717
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:00,559
charge. Wow. Relegation is just looking

718
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,840
absolutely perfect for them. And he's

719
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,600
coming actually did decent. You know

720
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,320
what I mean? I haven't looked at him as

721
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,200
a glaring

722
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,799
>> unbelievable.

723
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,760
>> Yeah. Like you know what is it? I I have

724
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:12,640
got to give respect to Henderson as a

725
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:14,880
just a top top model pro

726
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,720
>> and those model pros can play on for

727
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,120
years and years and years just through

728
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,640
their leadership. Now I think the reason

729
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,000
why I'm so against Henderson is because

730
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,919
he keeps getting called up for England

731
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,240
and that is really irking me.

732
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:27,679
>> So maybe that was a bit of a effect of

733
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,720
it. But do you know what? I will give

734
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:32,000
Jordan Henson credit. I had him I think

735
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,440
I think I did something where it was

736
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,960
like worst sign of the season. I think I

737
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,799
had him as worst sign of the season. I

738
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,559
genuinely think I did. That's

739
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,159
>> so

740
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:41,840
>> I think it's smart and I think if you

741
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,440
think of the way that they're playing it

742
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,880
works as well and

743
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,200
>> age ain't nothing but a number.

744
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,200
>> Yes.

745
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,960
>> 35 he's still got he's still got legs

746
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,559
enough. Yak maybe takes a second longer

747
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,480
to get there if he's got a bit of

748
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:54,480
protection around him legs around him. I

749
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,840
think he's in an okay place. So uh

750
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,760
Keller

751
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,840
>> I think

752
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,200
I think I think both of those are like

753
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,919
you're not are you feeling Henderson?

754
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,120
Have you moved away from that?

755
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,159
>> I'm going to put Henderson as will come

756
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,080
good.

757
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:07,520
>> Okay. Is there something? Is there

758
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,120
something Is there something between

759
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,720
will come good and huge?

760
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,159
>> I had huge potential.

761
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,039
>> Maybe that doesn't work. We can always

762
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,159
change it.

763
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,600
>> Keller is huge.

764
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,240
>> Just give it you can say where you can

765
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,240
give it wherever you want.

766
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,919
>> Keller is huge because if Brenford are

767
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,320
going to stay up, he needs to have a big

768
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:20,640
season.

769
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,440
>> Yeah.

770
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:27,039
>> So Kell Keller is huge. Henderson I'm

771
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,440
going to say will come good.

772
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,600
>> Okay.

773
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,640
>> For the season after this, guys, he's on

774
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,240
his own. You know what I mean?

775
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,200
>> I think they're both huge if I'm honest.

776
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:37,280
I think Anderson I think like him as a

777
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,720
and it feels a bit lazy analysis but

778
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,200
actually people don't concentrate on it

779
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:44,400
enough is like the leadership is is

780
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,080
enormous and the communication like I I

781
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,640
speak about this all the time but I went

782
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,720
to England Senagle in Qatar I've never

783
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,520
ever heard someone bark like that not

784
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,880
literally like just going at Sacka like

785
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,039
constantly

786
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:00,400
>> and I think it's yeah and he does it in

787
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:04,159
a way so Van Djk I was watching Van Dijk

788
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:07,280
Dan D was hammer ing Kenate at the

789
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:09,039
weekend. Move it like move it fast.

790
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,720
>> Play the part. I couldn't believe and

791
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:12,960
Kenate had a tough time. I think a big

792
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,039
part of that was

793
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,400
>> Van Dijk kind of on him. Yeah. A little

794
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:17,120
bit as much as a few different things,

795
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,640
right?

796
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,919
>> But yeah, Van Djke I feel like he's a

797
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:23,919
bit more gently a bit more like Mooney

798
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:26,320
than Henderson.

799
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:27,520
>> Yeah. Henderson. I think in a team like

800
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,360
that where you might be going through

801
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,960
difficult patches, won't have the ball

802
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,039
as much, you've got to have that

803
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,799
organization to keep you going. And I

804
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,360
think he I think he'll be huge. I really

805
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,360
do.

806
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,120
>> Xiao Pedro,

807
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,880
>> it's an interesting one.

808
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,200
>> They're struggling a little bit.

809
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:47,200
>> It is an interesting one cuz Jao Pedro

810
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:49,760
has quietly gone from oh the hope nine

811
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,159
to actually he's not really a nine, is

812
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:54,480
he? That's what I'm starting to mean. So

813
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,880
when that starts to happen,

814
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,799
>> Maize is like he's a bit like he's the

815
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,559
same way. He's kind of like he's not

816
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:02,799
really a nine, but he's not getting

817
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:04,799
opportunities and stuff. And I'm like I

818
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:07,279
saw a stat apparently that he his only

819
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,480
shot on target was the goal against West

820
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:08,799
Ham in September,

821
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,240
>> right?

822
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:12,240
>> So I'm like, wow, that means he's not

823
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,240
really getting anything. And the type of

824
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,360
player he is is that Jao Pra is not

825
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,200
going to wait for chances. He's going to

826
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,760
drop deep and try and run past players.

827
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:22,320
And he's very Gabrielle Jesus about him.

828
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,679
So then that also then limits you from

829
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,840
getting chances because you're trying to

830
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:27,600
create your own chance all of a sudden.

831
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,360
So he's in a tough position because

832
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,200
already if you're only six games in and

833
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,640
people are like, "Oh, you're actually

834
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,159
not a number nine."

835
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,919
>> Then you got a concern there. People are

836
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,159
generally talking like maybe he'll get

837
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,400
20 goals this season. And I was like

838
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:41,200
that's

839
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:43,520
>> I mean I've not heard I I'm not out and

840
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,520
I'm not about like reading too much of

841
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,360
that but I'm surprised but I'm surprised

842
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,120
but that like two weeks ago he was like

843
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,799
signing of the season. This is what I

844
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,520
mean, right? And now you're looking at

845
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:55,039
it and I'm like, hm, were we just all

846
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,440
excited off the club world cup a little

847
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,760
bit?

848
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,760
>> Well, but I mean, we're suggesting that

849
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,600
that's true. I don't think that's true.

850
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,279
>> I get you in terms of like him going

851
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,159
looking for the ball a little bit too

852
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:05,120
much.

853
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:06,640
>> I I mean, I think

854
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,679
>> is he a nine though?

855
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,320
>> Is he a nine?

856
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:12,400
>> Cuz some people like, "Oh, no, play J."

857
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:14,559
But now you got Palmer, you got Enzo

858
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,960
Fernandez who's turned into like Kevin

859
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:19,760
Nolan regen and it's like

860
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:23,120
>> it's about what do you want? Like do you

861
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,400
>> So do you want Yarez Dap N? Is that what

862
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:28,640
is that what Chelsea want?

863
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:30,000
>> I think that's Chelsea heritage manel

864
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,919
situation is a complicated one

865
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,080
>> to Yeah. Oh yeah it is. I mean all the

866
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:37,279
ones that I've worked out Jimmy Floyd

867
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:40,000
Hasselbank and then Drogba and Costa and

868
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:40,640
like they felt like proper even Jaru to

869
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,360
an extent.

870
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,120
>> Yeah.

871
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,760
>> And then you got these ones that Chelsea

872
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,120
had Maratas and stuff and then J Pedro

873
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,960
and stuff they're just a bit

874
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,279
>> you need a firm Yeah. They need a firm

875
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,200
one.

876
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:53,200
>> Feels like a Chelsea striker but if he

877
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,600
had the quality to match of course that

878
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,520
that's up for debate for people

879
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,799
>> but the way he plays feels like a

880
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,799
Chelsea striker

881
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:02,559
>> but again it's a new Chelsea in It's not

882
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:04,799
the same Chelsea. So,

883
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:05,919
>> yeah. And I think there's there's been

884
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:07,600
things at play, right? If you think the

885
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:09,760
last two Premier League games, players

886
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,880
sent off in both. I think that system

887
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,039
struggles

888
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,200
>> once you're once you lose a player cuz

889
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:17,039
it's a kind of about utilizing the width

890
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,559
a lot of the time. That was what I was

891
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:20,080
going to say about Pedro is like when

892
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:21,760
you've got the wingers, wide players

893
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,520
that they have, they are wingers. Yeah.

894
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,640
They are not um I mean go a natural

895
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,159
movie is slightly different but they're

896
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,840
not like a I'm going to make that guy

897
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,919
going to run in behind you so you

898
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:32,799
dropping deep's okay like like a you

899
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:34,480
know like Salah and Gako so when he is

900
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:36,240
doing that instead of being like the the

901
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,320
point of the arrow let's say

902
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,240
>> like if you think of me at leard was

903
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,760
that like he'd stay up there right

904
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,720
>> so that could be a bit of a problem with

905
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:47,279
with Pedro at times but losing a couple

906
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,200
of players isn't isn't great that said

907
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:51,039
it's not a great start to the season you

908
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,400
know not being able to break down Palace

909
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:54,960
who But we know they're really really

910
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:57,120
good defensively. West Ham 51 win. Yeah.

911
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,720
But West Ham are pretty bad. I think

912
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,080
four of those goals are from corners.

913
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,000
>> Yeah. Yeah. Three, four set pieces.

914
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,600
>> Fulham, good home win at Derby.

915
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,279
Brenford, that's two derbies to be fair

916
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,880
to you. There's three. That's four.

917
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:08,960
>> They stayed in London. They stayed in

918
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,799
London up until Man United. And that's

919
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:14,000
why beginning of the season,

920
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:16,320
>> I put Chelsea to be after five games top

921
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,559
of the table cuz I feel they're not

922
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,559
traveling. They're just going to

923
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:21,279
>> blow blow these London teams away. And

924
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,080
it's not like

925
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:24,240
>> look at it that way.

926
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,240
>> Do you I do I was thinking about if it

927
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,320
was like Tottenham and Arsenal in there

928
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,919
where I know these are London derbies,

929
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,360
right? But Tottenham and Arsenal and

930
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:33,679
maybe West Ham are the ones that are

931
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,919
maybe a bit more something to them,

932
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,279
right?

933
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:36,720
>> This is Man United lens coming out,

934
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,039
right? This let me tell you where you're

935
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,360
wrong.

936
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:41,840
>> Like but do do Chelsea view like Palace

937
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,960
as like a rivalry?

938
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,520
>> That is irrelevant.

939
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,399
>> You think so?

940
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,960
>> Do you know what's relevant?

941
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,799
>> What do you think?

942
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,360
>> What do Palace think? What do Brenford

943
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:49,600
think? M

944
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,960
>> so when Brenford go and play

945
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,919
>> okay I get what you're saying

946
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:56,880
>> when Brenford go and play Man City

947
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:58,799
>> big game but you know probably not going

948
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,799
to win that one blah blah blah blah

949
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:03,279
>> when you playing when it's London games

950
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:06,080
and especially if you are the favorite

951
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:07,600
>> that game goes from likelihood of

952
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,200
winning being that to that

953
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,080
>> because this is a cup final for Palace

954
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,520
and for for

955
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,480
>> I didn't think of it from that angle to

956
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,880
be fair I was only thinking about it

957
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,640
from that is a good point very very

958
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,760
>> so those London games are really

959
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,000
annoying

960
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,679
more cuz even if you have like QPI Lynn

961
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,039
Championship where we'd have a lot of uh

962
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:24,159
you know when we there were a lot of

963
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:26,080
London they're all in the Premier League

964
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:28,480
now annually but like when they were all

965
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,880
there you'd go even like Watford or

966
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,880
Charlton you go

967
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,600
>> it's not really a derby but it kind of

968
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,039
is and you're up for it so like and I'm

969
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,919
not I don't know if Watford care or not

970
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:40,559
but it just adds an annoy Yeah. an

971
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:42,320
annoyance.

972
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:44,240
>> That's a good point. I was only thinking

973
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,440
about it in a way of like

974
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,880
>> ain't got to travel far.

975
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,480
>> Yeah. they're just gonna it's gonna be

976
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,760
kind of comfortable and stuff

977
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,880
>> and they're the better team. So I was

978
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,360
thinking all right that's good for them

979
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,480
to start that way but when like the away

980
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,000
games you know you don't want to go

981
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,840
Newcastle you don't want to go I was

982
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,200
thinking oh away games perfect

983
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,679
>> but to be honest I didn't think about it

984
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,039
from the lower teams point of view that

985
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,360
yeah they're going to get up for it.

986
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:08,000
>> Yeah cuz in truth you're actually better

987
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,120
off going further a field before the

988
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,559
Champions League kicks in

989
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,880
>> and you got like the churn and the

990
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:16,000
league cup and those things. Um, so

991
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,720
yeah, interesting. The um, so Pedro,

992
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,840
will he come good?

993
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,600
>> I'm going to say he will come good

994
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:25,600
because I can't see him being a flop.

995
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:28,399
>> Um, and I like the player. My thing with

996
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:31,600
Yarez was I don't like the player, but I

997
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:32,880
do think he would do okay.

998
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,000
>> So I had to put him not really feeling

999
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,799
cuz I'm not I'm not really feeling the

1000
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,279
player.

1001
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:39,279
>> But I do like the player of Pedro. So

1002
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:43,120
I'll say we'll come good.

1003
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:46,240
>> Okay. I I really rate Pedro.

1004
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,279
>> I've got I think he will come good.

1005
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,960
>> I think we're good.

1006
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:51,120
>> Yeah. But him being that lone striker is

1007
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,080
slightly slightly problematic because I

1008
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,760
don't think he I don't think he

1009
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,600
wholeheartedly wants to be he like him

1010
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:58,399
with Wellbeck amount of goals where he

1011
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:00,000
got the the G, but Wellbeck had like

1012
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:01,840
>> they zipped into Wellbeck. He popped it

1013
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:06,000
off beautifully and Pedro's facing this

1014
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:08,000
way with Mint and um Mita ready to go.

1015
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,159
But I think he will overall come good.

1016
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,080
Maybe not huge though.

1017
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,960
>> Garnacho and Gittens. We put them

1018
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,279
together.

1019
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,840
>> 92 minutes for Garnacho so far. 215 for

1020
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:19,760
Gittens. Combined cost of around 90

1021
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:21,200
million. Selling Noni Mawa. He's a

1022
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,520
ripple coming.

1023
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:26,880
>> And Nicholas Jackson has reset the trust

1024
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:28,799
cycle for Enzo Maresa. Chelsea's model

1025
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,480
relies on signing young players who are

1026
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,600
then developed to fit their system and

1027
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,120
grow into their surroundings. last

1028
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,360
season. Two of Chelsea's main attacking

1029
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,200
options, Noni Madaweki Jackson, both of

1030
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,279
whom were in their second full season at

1031
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,640
the club, had begun to earn Mesca's

1032
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:42,159
trust. However, by selling these

1033
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,080
players, Chelsea have now seemingly

1034
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:45,360
reset the process, signing Gitens, who

1035
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,760
is extremely talented, but also

1036
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:49,679
extremely raw, and Garnacho, who has to

1037
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,039
prove himself after his troubles at Man

1038
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,880
United.

1039
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:55,039
>> You agree with that?

1040
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,640
>> Yes, I agree with it.

1041
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,919
>> The settling period is important. I I

1042
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,799
was thinking about this for like maybe a

1043
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:02,720
future podcast of like

1044
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:04,320
or if you're predicting a new season.

1045
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,919
There's something smart in going who's

1046
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,880
in their second season.

1047
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:08,159
>> I think there's something about that

1048
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,080
when they like you go, "All right, I've

1049
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,600
lived here a year. I understand the

1050
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,679
rhythm of all of this and now I can

1051
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,679
maybe like push on whereas like for

1052
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:17,440
these guys Esau as well of course it's a

1053
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:19,279
lot of new stuff going on." And that's

1054
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,559
awkward when I think Chelsea have come

1055
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:22,080
off the summer that they've had.

1056
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:23,519
>> Yeah. cuz everyone thinks like, oh,

1057
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:26,159
you'll be the ones

1058
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:28,559
>> and I'm we're not seeing it so far.

1059
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:31,200
>> Feel like

1060
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:33,600
not really feeling these. Not really

1061
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,679
feeling these. And the reason is because

1062
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:38,080
I don't think the expectation of what

1063
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:40,000
Chelsea need is what those players will

1064
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:42,720
give them. You know what I mean? Chelsea

1065
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,880
though Giton's not really feeling that

1066
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:47,200
one. And Ganacho, when I'm looking at

1067
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,600
Ganacho, I know Chelsea because he got

1068
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,279
decent GA and stuff at United. I do

1069
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:55,360
think Chelsea fans are going to expect

1070
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:56,960
that but even more in abundance because

1071
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:59,039
Chelsea's attackers none of them

1072
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,880
guarantee you goals at the moment. None.

1073
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:02,960
J Pedro don't guarantee you goals. Even

1074
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,399
when his highscoring seasons at Brighton

1075
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,960
10, he scored 10 penalties in one

1076
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,399
season.

1077
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,480
>> Do you know what I mean? So, he doesn't

1078
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:11,200
guarantee you goals. You look at the

1079
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,320
right winger, Pedroto literally does not

1080
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,480
give you goals.

1081
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,679
>> And then you look at the left winger and

1082
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,600
I think that left winger, if it's

1083
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:19,919
Ganacho, eventually they're going to

1084
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:22,240
expect a lot of end product from him.

1085
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:25,760
And I've watched Ganacho, that end

1086
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:28,080
product may come. However, you are going

1087
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,440
to have to roll with the frustrations.

1088
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,360
Oh my god, there's going to be so many

1089
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,200
times it's not going to come. So, it's

1090
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:35,919
kind of like

1091
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,679
>> a tough one. Chelsea is not Man United

1092
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,600
as well. He came through Carrington and

1093
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:41,760
we often

1094
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:44,000
give people time a lot of the time and

1095
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,919
you know we we're we pride ourselves on

1096
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,279
giving players time and all this stuff.

1097
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:49,600
Chelsea, they're not that type of

1098
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:51,279
football club especially because they're

1099
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,640
bringing in so many revolving door. It's

1100
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,640
going to oh yeah, you're here for a

1101
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,000
stay. We'll sell you next summer 35.

1102
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,279
We'll take a 5m minute loss if we need.

1103
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,440
Actually, Chelsea are great sellers. So

1104
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:01,519
they'll probably make profit somehow

1105
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:04,559
>> and then that's all it is. So with

1106
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:06,240
Gitens not really high on the player to

1107
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:08,000
to be honest. Um

1108
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,520
>> I don't see okay I know they're not

1109
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,200
playing in the same role cuz non is

1110
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,879
obviously on the right hand side but I

1111
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:15,440
look at like Git I don't see him as an

1112
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:17,359
improvement on like a nonies and stuff.

1113
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:20,079
So when I'm looking at Ganacho and

1114
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:23,359
Gitens, I am not really feeling combined

1115
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:25,040
90 million when you think to yourself,

1116
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:26,639
what if that money could have just been

1117
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:29,280
used on a

1118
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:31,760
>> I don't know 90 million on a on a rafale

1119
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,919
or something like that or you know a

1120
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,760
real needle mover. I don't see these two

1121
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:36,560
moving the I do not look at them two and

1122
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,520
think

1123
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,599
>> I don't even look at them and think

1124
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,960
Chelsea's improved as attack um attack

1125
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,800
has improved from last season.

1126
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,240
>> Yeah, I don't. I think has it

1127
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,520
>> caught in the It feels a bit caught in

1128
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,879
the churn

1129
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,320
>> of it like now

1130
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:50,879
>> like I don't know enough about Giddens

1131
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,079
to be honest like I've seen bits and

1132
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:53,919
I've seen a couple of games with him

1133
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:55,520
playing in and and you know there's lots

1134
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:57,599
there's lots to likes I wouldn't you

1135
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:59,200
know and again with all of these guys

1136
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:00,320
everyone's ready to prove us wrong

1137
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,079
that's the whole point but it's just

1138
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:04,160
having a discussion but the

1139
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:06,800
>> but yeah I agree with you like

1140
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:07,920
>> it's funny isn't it like when Nimiki

1141
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,359
went

1142
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,200
>> you know the feeling around that and

1143
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:13,280
then a couple of games you go oh Yeah,

1144
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,280
>> he's I like him. He's direct. He's

1145
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,200
>> I had high expectations for Chelsea this

1146
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,040
season. They they really they really

1147
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,720
disappointed me and

1148
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:23,680
>> I do think I got caught a little bit

1149
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:25,119
with the the Club World Cup and the way

1150
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,640
they ended the season. I was thinking,

1151
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:28,160
"Oh, okay. Chelsea might be one of them

1152
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,320
ones." But now I'm looking at it and I'm

1153
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:32,320
like I just had the lens over my eyes

1154
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,680
because honestly I'm looking I'm like

1155
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,320
there's not much they got going like

1156
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:38,560
they really need they need a special

1157
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,640
Cole Palmer season again and I don't see

1158
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,400
that coming because you can't really

1159
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:45,839
he's actually quietly having fitness

1160
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,800
issues like Cole Palmer these days. So I

1161
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:48,800
can't see them

1162
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,839
>> I need more anger in that team. Like I

1163
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,240
feel like there

1164
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:54,800
>> they feel a little bit like there

1165
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,599
>> I'm fed up. It feels like it not sulky

1166
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,200
but like

1167
00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:00,480
>> and not I don't want to say soft but

1168
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:02,800
like it's just young where you go go

1169
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:06,560
>> like Henderson that when you think you

1170
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:07,920
hard like like sort of like standard.

1171
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,320
Yes. That's what I was going to say.

1172
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,640
There's a few like plays well.

1173
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,119
>> Yeah.

1174
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,880
>> I think Kaisedo I think they're the I

1175
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:16,880
think week in week out those are the

1176
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,640
only two consistent players. Kaisedo and

1177
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:21,040
Kukara and that's a concern. That's only

1178
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:24,000
two of 11. So,

1179
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:26,240
>> and the like the system

1180
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:30,079
Yeah. I'm not sure the system will ever

1181
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:32,079
get an outrageous amount over out of

1182
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:34,640
those wide players in terms of like what

1183
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:36,880
you really really really are after. Um,

1184
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,079
so yeah, yeah, not feeling it.

1185
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,200
>> Not feeling at the moment now.

1186
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:40,720
>> And I don't think you'll get a full

1187
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:43,680
refund.

1188
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:45,680
>> That's the thing because if it's 90, you

1189
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,040
know, what's that 45 maybe, you know,

1190
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,560
Gens was more, wasn't it? I think it

1191
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,440
>> was 55. I think it was, right?

1192
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,160
>> Yeah. Yeah. Are you going to get full

1193
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,920
refund?

1194
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,960
>> I don't know. I'm not sure refund can be

1195
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,880
put in there.

1196
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:58,000
>> Um, right. Let's move on. Jack Greish.

1197
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,720
>> So,

1198
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,440
>> yeah.

1199
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,040
>> Huge.

1200
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,960
>> I think so.

1201
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:05,040
>> Do you know what the problem?

1202
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:07,040
>> The problem not that he's got or or

1203
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:10,160
sorry, the hidden weapon that he has is

1204
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:12,480
the amount of and it's it hurts him too

1205
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,839
a little bit. He gets fouled so much.

1206
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,320
>> I've never seen anyone get fouled so

1207
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:16,480
much.

1208
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,320
>> He's also brilliant at winning a foul.

1209
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,680
>> Um, which is great. That's why I'd

1210
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,640
always kind of if I can get him in an

1211
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,520
England squad, that could be really

1212
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,800
useful because if you've got 20 minutes

1213
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,880
left, go, "Look, mate,

1214
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,800
>> let's get Harry on. Let's get Harry

1215
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:29,200
McGuire on. Let's score some goals." But

1216
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,920
the um the one question I would have,

1217
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,720
right,

1218
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,920
>> a question for all Everton fans, all

1219
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,720
fans, full stop.

1220
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:38,320
>> Um he's got 34 progressive carries so

1221
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,280
far this season. And I actually when we

1222
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,440
did a video on the Premier League a

1223
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,960
couple of weeks ago about him and it was

1224
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,880
amazing like at this point in the season

1225
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:47,520
the reps he's getting in terms of let's

1226
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,000
get the ball to Jack Greish and Jack off

1227
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,640
you go.

1228
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,960
>> Mhm.

1229
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:53,040
>> He's going to have so many hopefully

1230
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,560
opportunities to really you know create

1231
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,000
good moments but also then if that's not

1232
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,599
really working go win some fouls. Set

1233
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,400
pieces come from that as well.

1234
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:02,640
>> But um I don't know if this is the

1235
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:05,920
option but it sounds like it is. Would

1236
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:08,400
you pay 50 million if you're Everton for

1237
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,119
a 31-year-old Jack Greish at the end of

1238
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,760
this season?

1239
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:11,839
>> No.

1240
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:15,280
>> Regardless of how well he plays,

1241
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:16,720
>> I wouldn't do that. No. Because you just

1242
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,160
don't know when that star can come. And

1243
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,680
when you look at Everton, you said huge.

1244
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:21,040
>> No, I think it's huge, but they need to

1245
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,119
negotiate that down.

1246
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:25,920
>> Give me a 30 million. 30 million. Can

1247
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:28,720
you do that? But 50 million

1248
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:31,359
especially Everton as especially as a

1249
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:34,000
football club. Everton, they are like

1250
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:36,000
the lower table Man United in terms of

1251
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,680
their business over the last 10 years

1252
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,440
has been scandalous. Do you know what I

1253
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,560
mean? In terms of how much they spent

1254
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,640
and what they've actually got out of

1255
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:45,280
them players. So, Everton really got to

1256
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:48,720
think about that like 50 million for a

1257
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:50,800
31 year old. And right now, Jack Greish,

1258
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:52,640
the concern is we always talk about

1259
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,160
players contract year players, right?

1260
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,400
Like players that are playing for their

1261
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:58,240
contract. Jack Grees right now is

1262
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,720
playing for a move. Whether it's for

1263
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:03,119
Everton or it's for someone else, he's

1264
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:04,800
playing and a World Cup year. He's got

1265
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:07,200
there's so much motivation. Chip on his

1266
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,800
shoulder cuz he got moved out of city.

1267
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,320
He needs to get a contract forever from

1268
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,280
Everton or someone else. And that's

1269
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,960
three motivations.

1270
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,560
>> He's getting so much love, isn't he?

1271
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,960
>> And he's instantly walked in getting the

1272
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:19,839
love becoming a bit of a cult hero.

1273
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:23,040
>> But you now signing 50 million all of a

1274
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:26,160
sudden it's World Cup years done. I can

1275
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:28,000
settle and you might not get the same.

1276
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,480
>> I think he's got two is it two is it two

1277
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,160
years

1278
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,200
>> really? I wonder if he did he sign he

1279
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,040
wouldn't have signed any kind of

1280
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:36,079
extension I'm guessing.

1281
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:37,520
>> Um if I can even find it here contract

1282
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:39,119
expires 2027.

1283
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:41,280
>> Yeah.

1284
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:43,040
>> Okay. What's that? Two years

1285
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:45,280
>> and then by the time it's done we about

1286
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,760
one year. 50 is a lot. It's a lot. It's

1287
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,359
a lot of money.

1288
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,160
>> I think you get I think 30 might I think

1289
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:49,359
30 is good.

1290
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,599
>> Yeah. I think that's

1291
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:53,280
>> if any could be quite pushy with it cuz

1292
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,400
if he's just like utterly loved and goes

1293
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,960
look I just want to spend next five

1294
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,520
years here.

1295
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,000
>> Yeah.

1296
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,440
>> Then like there's that could work in

1297
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
terms of getting that price down. But

1298
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,760
yeah, interesting. Uh yeah, I think huge

1299
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,119
this season for them. I think they'd be

1300
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,800
fine regardless, but it could be the

1301
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:07,440
difference between 12th and eighth or

1302
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,880
ninth

1303
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,400
>> if you if they really really go for it.

1304
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,440
Although you've not been outrageously

1305
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,720
good so far,

1306
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,839
>> but yeah, it's great to see him there.

1307
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,960
Good to see him getting on the ball,

1308
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:16,480
getting reps. Yeah,

1309
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,480
>> Jbury Hall

1310
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,720
>> there as well. He's only 27. Jbury Hall.

1311
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,720
Yeah,

1312
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,800
>> he might be the first person to get

1313
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:24,880
suspended for bookings this year. And

1314
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,000
one of those ones was from the quick

1315
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:29,040
>> free kick.

1316
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,800
>> Um, this is I think this is

1317
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,160
>> I think this is Oh,

1318
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,240
>> I like about Will come good. I think

1319
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,359
it's huge. I think it's huge cuz I think

1320
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,680
he'll be that's it now.

1321
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:37,119
>> Yeah,

1322
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,400
>> I think he stays there. I think he's at

1323
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:38,800
least there. I think he's there five

1324
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,200
years.

1325
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,320
>> I see that.

1326
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,040
>> And I think they love him and I think

1327
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,079
he's great.

1328
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,320
>> I like that signing.

1329
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:44,000
>> Yeah,

1330
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,240
>> I like it. I I'll put it as huge as

1331
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,839
well.

1332
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,520
>> There are players like that though. If

1333
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:49,200
they're at a bit like we were talking

1334
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,880
last podcast, we were saying certain

1335
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,000
players if you brought them back into

1336
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,720
Man United would people just turn their

1337
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,119
nose up at him.

1338
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,760
>> Yeah.

1339
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:56,480
>> J Hall, I think if he if he goes that is

1340
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:59,520
his

1341
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:01,040
>> that's his level. That's his saying that

1342
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,240
is that is I mean that's there's no

1343
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,680
shame in that man. You know what I mean?

1344
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,240
There's no shame in some people

1345
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,880
>> good player

1346
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:08,560
>> finding their level and some people are

1347
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,560
just steady not steady but some people

1348
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:12,560
are just performing Premier League

1349
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:14,720
players for their career. Like it's I

1350
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:17,200
was talking to Aobi about it um when I

1351
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:18,240
interviewed him and we were like I was

1352
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,520
like it's actually incredible that

1353
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:22,079
you've been a Prem player your whole

1354
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:23,359
career like but you are just I don't

1355
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:26,160
want to say just cuz again that sounds

1356
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:27,839
crazy but you are just a performing

1357
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,240
Premier League player and you will be

1358
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:29,040
that

1359
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,839
>> triple pay.

1360
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:34,079
>> Yeah. Yeah. you will be that for the

1361
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:35,920
rest of your career like just Prem level

1362
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:37,760
like but I don't think

1363
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:40,160
>> and I don't think he even thinks it like

1364
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:42,000
that he's oh okay I'm going to go off

1365
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:44,000
again and go back to Arsenal I'm going

1366
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,560
to go to city I'm going to go no you

1367
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,839
will be Fulham and these teams but

1368
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,280
>> mate you're going to be that's that's a

1369
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:50,640
great career at the end of the day you

1370
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,560
mean I see that I think that's the same

1371
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:54,000
for Drewsby Hall even though he did drop

1372
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:56,240
down to the championship but yeah I

1373
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,880
think that's way too good for the German

1374
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:00,640
>> but that whole team was Anton Stack at

1375
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:03,440
Leads Leads

1376
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:05,680
have a physical team. He's good. Do you

1377
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:08,079
I was looking at it this morning. He's

1378
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:10,319
sprinted. He's ran

1379
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:10,960
>> more than anyone in the league.

1380
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,240
>> Like full stop.

1381
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,720
>> I haven't really paid attention to this

1382
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,079
guy.

1383
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,119
>> So he's Oh, I was trying to find like

1384
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:16,400
cuz I was wondering how like how many

1385
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:18,240
sprints and stuff he's done. He's sort

1386
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:22,480
of Yeah. hardworking midfielder, a big

1387
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:24,240
boy. Um 6'2. Um and that that's what

1388
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,839
leads have kind of gone down that road.

1389
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,839
Like you can tell Danny Foggles are

1390
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:30,880
really big on like let's not get bullied

1391
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:32,079
at least. Um and like uh Lang Stuff as

1392
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,800
well. Long stuff. Long stuff. Long

1393
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:36,079
stuff. Long stuff.

1394
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:38,319
>> Sean Long Staff. Yeah. Scored a kind of

1395
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:40,160
fortunate goal the weekend. But yeah, I

1396
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:42,480
he makes them really really solid. Uh

1397
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:44,319
he's got slight Pinia vibes as well. I

1398
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,000
think he's I I'll take this one. I think

1399
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:48,000
he's um

1400
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,720
>> he I think he's huge cuz I think

1401
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,720
literally he's huge, but also he's 26.

1402
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:54,880
So I think he will be Premier. He'll be

1403
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,400
a triple P by the end of the

1404
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:58,720
>> Premier League player.

1405
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,720
>> I like it when you phrase the board. uh

1406
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:02,800
he will be a triple P by the end of the

1407
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:04,240
season. So again, if if it does if you

1408
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,839
aren't able to get it done, it's not one

1409
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,960
where like you're going to be you'd

1410
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:08,800
either love him in the Championship,

1411
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,240
which I don't think he would need to do.

1412
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,680
Um and it' be interesting if Lead is

1413
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,160
going to stay up. Like they they look

1414
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,680
solid.

1415
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,720
>> The three promoter teams have been a lot

1416
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,160
better than I thought.

1417
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:18,480
>> Yeah. And technically, he's pretty good

1418
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,760
as well. I think it'll be one by the end

1419
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,880
of the season, I think there'll be a lot

1420
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,480
of talk about him. I think he's been

1421
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,920
amazing, a really solid signing for them

1422
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:27,359
so far from what I've seen.

1423
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:28,960
>> Uh here we go. Florian Verts

1424
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:30,240
0078

1425
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,040
I just see. Oh no, he's got an assist.

1426
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:35,280
He's got assist. He's got

1427
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:36,240
>> assist. Florian verts. This one is

1428
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,000
>> you know Florian.

1429
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:39,920
>> I went big on this guy. I kept saying I

1430
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,640
go he's he's you've bought a Premier

1431
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,720
League great.

1432
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,440
>> Yeah. Wow. Wow. I didn't I didn't go

1433
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,880
that far. No.

1434
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,800
>> I'm holding firm. I think

1435
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,480
>> I'm a fan of Florian BS. I'm not going

1436
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:52,800
to flip-flop. I'm not going to switch up

1437
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:54,720
now. But I I am a little even though

1438
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,079
I've used to watch him at Le Vusen, but

1439
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:58,560
again it all depends on the league

1440
00:43:56,079 --> 00:44:00,160
you're in and stuff like that. But I am

1441
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:03,200
startled. I'm getting a little bit

1442
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:05,040
scared with how physically weak he is.

1443
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,400
>> I'm like you are getting pushed off. You

1444
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:08,480
>> think he's that physically weak?

1445
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:12,280
>> He's getting pushed off the ball like

1446
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:12,280
and he's not listen

1447
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:17,200
right but he found he used to know how

1448
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:19,200
to shield the ball, keep the ball away

1449
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,480
from you, use your body. I'm looking at

1450
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,920
Verts and I'm like, "Bro, you're

1451
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,200
literally just like telling them come

1452
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,119
get the ball off me." And they're just

1453
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:27,359
pushing you off the ball and he's not

1454
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:29,359
bursting past players. And I'm like,

1455
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:30,960
"Don't. You're giving me a Sancho vibes

1456
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:32,560
quite early on, man. You're giving me

1457
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,200
Sancho vibes right now." So,

1458
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,520
>> sure, man.

1459
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:37,839
>> So, I'm going to say he will come good

1460
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:40,000
because again, I will be seriously

1461
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:41,520
flip-flopping if I just turn around now.

1462
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,520
>> So, why did you like him? Answer that.

1463
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:46,160
>> I I love intelligence.

1464
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:48,160
>> I love um people that have like good

1465
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:50,400
first touches, you know what I mean? His

1466
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,440
incisive dribbling is is brilliant and

1467
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,440
one thing I always thought was

1468
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,119
underrated about him is that is his

1469
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:58,400
shooting ability. I think a lot of

1470
00:44:55,119 --> 00:45:00,400
people I think Prem fans honestly have

1471
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:02,000
misprofiled him a little bit. I was

1472
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,280
seeing Prem fans talking about him like

1473
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,240
coming to the club and they were talking

1474
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:10,079
about him a little bit in a way that in

1475
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:11,359
a like in a silver ozil kind of vibe

1476
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:13,200
where they were like oh we're going to

1477
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:16,400
get this like playmaker who's going to

1478
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:18,240
be and I was like he for for me he feels

1479
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:20,880
a lot more of like a shooter a lot more

1480
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,839
of like a more creative than a Phil

1481
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:25,200
Foden

1482
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:27,839
>> but more on that kind of kind of path

1483
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,560
where Fod score yeah dribble line score

1484
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:30,000
shoot

1485
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,680
>> and I was hearing People would talk like

1486
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,839
he's going to be this kind of like ball

1487
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:35,359
dominant kind of and I was like you're

1488
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:36,720
getting the you're getting the wrong

1489
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:38,800
player here. You know what I mean? He's

1490
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:40,480
not that type of player. So

1491
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:42,640
>> I think he was already misprofiled from

1492
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:44,640
the start. So the the exaggeration

1493
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:46,560
around his performances are there

1494
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,839
because people have to overcompensate

1495
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,359
always happens.

1496
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:51,760
>> But

1497
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:55,839
I think he will come good.

1498
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:58,800
>> But my butts with him is what is good?

1499
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:59,280
Because we have to be honest, 116

1500
00:45:58,800 --> 00:45:59,920
million.

1501
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:02,640
>> Yeah.

1502
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:07,280
>> What we how he was spoken about before

1503
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:08,880
signing good for me is like

1504
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:10,720
he has to be as you you said Premier

1505
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,160
League great. Like he has to be like one

1506
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:14,240
of the he has to be one of the best

1507
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:16,079
players in the Premier League.

1508
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:17,599
>> I don't know. I'm scared about that a

1509
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:19,280
little bit, but I don't think he I think

1510
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:21,440
he'll come good. But will he ever live

1511
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,560
James? Would he ever live to to his 116

1512
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,560
million price tag?

1513
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:26,160
>> Okay.

1514
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,960
>> Yeah. He's going to be there a long

1515
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,599
time.

1516
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:31,119
>> Okay.

1517
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:32,000
>> So, yes, he is. I think a few things.

1518
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:33,359
First of all, I was just trying to find

1519
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,200
it and I'm not good enough on the Excel

1520
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:39,040
spreadsheet to to do it properly, but

1521
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:41,839
I've got he's made

1522
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:43,359
he's made 108

1523
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:45,440
sprints.

1524
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:45,760
>> I used to see these stats for me oil

1525
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,319
man.

1526
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:50,240
>> Right. No. And bear with me with this

1527
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:51,839
like and I'm I'm looking around and I'm

1528
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,960
seeing I'm not seeing a lot. Name

1529
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:54,480
another player because I'm having to do

1530
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:56,560
it through fire. Never know a player who

1531
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:58,160
should be similar role as Vert.

1532
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:00,400
>> Um

1533
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:02,800
similar role.

1534
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:04,400
>> Oh, my mind's gone blank. Um well, he's

1535
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:07,920
talking about like a number 10.

1536
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:09,920
>> Yeah. Trying to think. So, let's say um

1537
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:11,359
it's hard cuz who's played every single

1538
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,800
game. I was going to say someone like

1539
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:14,000
Kuna or something like that, but he

1540
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,200
wouldn't. He hasn't played every single

1541
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,200
game. Look,

1542
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:21,040
>> number 10. Yeah, number 10's in the game

1543
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:22,560
these days. Ezra,

1544
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:26,240
right? Don't worry about that. The point

1545
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:28,160
is, the point is a lot of players um

1546
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:29,599
very few players are making that amount

1547
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,960
of runs. I think

1548
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:31,760
>> is that good for him though?

1549
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,319
>> No.

1550
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:35,680
>> No. I think when you think of Vert

1551
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:37,119
>> Mhm.

1552
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,920
>> you're thinking of a 10. Are you When

1553
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:40,800
you're thinking of a 10, are you

1554
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:41,280
thinking of someone running in behind?

1555
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,240
>> No,

1556
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:45,440
>> you're not. You're not.

1557
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:47,440
>> I think And look, who am I? Right. I

1558
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:49,280
think Anna Slot knows far more about

1559
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:51,200
football than I do, right? and he's got

1560
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:54,319
to find what works for for Liverpool

1561
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:55,359
right now. I feel like he's not the

1562
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:56,319
aside yet.

1563
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:57,839
>> Yep. I agree.

1564
00:47:56,319 --> 00:48:00,160
>> Right. And so you've kind of and if you

1565
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:04,000
think of how they're playing, Ekit looks

1566
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:05,280
great. Right. Echo is doing what he

1567
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,400
>> Well, one of the several skills that

1568
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,839
he's really good at, but in terms of

1569
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,200
like him dropping in, pick up the ball

1570
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:10,079
and then knitting it together and then

1571
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,920
going,

1572
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:14,560
>> the reason he's able to kind of do that

1573
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:18,079
and it work is Vert is running be past

1574
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:20,560
him a lot of the time. where at leakm

1575
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:22,240
that whole team was set up to give him

1576
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:23,839
the ball.

1577
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:25,440
>> He doesn't get the ball. He's not

1578
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:27,200
getting the ball the same amount in my

1579
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:29,680
opinion. He's not being able to like

1580
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:31,760
stand there and people zip it into him.

1581
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:33,280
He's having to go and get it when he

1582
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:35,599
does go and get it.

1583
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:39,760
>> So I don't I feel like that team is

1584
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:42,880
still working to ideally work for the

1585
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:44,160
you know Ekit so far. get Salah on the

1586
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,520
ball at the end of it all. Yeah.

1587
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,640
>> Or you've obviously got gakpo on the

1588
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,839
other side as well, so he needs to get

1589
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,119
him involved. He's probably gonna want

1590
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:50,720
to come inside as well. So that's kind

1591
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:54,079
of your space again as well.

1592
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:57,440
>> So I think currently he's not the team's

1593
00:48:54,079 --> 00:49:00,559
not set up in a way that where it's all

1594
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:02,880
about him just yet. I wonder

1595
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:04,400
>> with this coming through the door,

1596
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,119
>> I think this could be a real season of

1597
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,680
struggle for him.

1598
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:08,319
>> Yeah. Okay.

1599
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:10,559
>> I think next season, certainly the

1600
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:13,280
season after that, if you know, if the

1601
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:15,599
belief is stays with him, which I don't

1602
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:17,200
think it should go away too far.

1603
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:19,520
>> Salah won't be there forever. Yeah.

1604
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:22,000
>> And I think when that changes, I think

1605
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:23,599
you can it can be far more about him.

1606
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,079
But right now, it's just not about him

1607
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:27,359
for enough. So, he's having to do things

1608
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:28,640
>> he doesn't really want to do.

1609
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:30,559
>> Yeah. That's the thing. When some

1610
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:32,319
players go to clubs,

1611
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:35,359
>> you become you are the system and then

1612
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:36,800
you become a cog in the system. And when

1613
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:39,599
with somebody that throw in verse now,

1614
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:41,680
he's just a cog in many moving pieces.

1615
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:44,000
And it's like how do you match up to

1616
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:45,359
that? And but the greats find a way. I

1617
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,680
always think about like Gareth Bale when

1618
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:50,319
he went to Real Madrid from what he was

1619
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:52,000
at Spurs, he was the system, but then he

1620
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:53,440
goes to Real Madrid, there's Cristiano

1621
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,280
there, there's all these players,

1622
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:57,040
>> but he's so good that he still found a

1623
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:58,720
way of playing. But if you look at the

1624
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:00,800
way he played at Real Madrid to the way

1625
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:02,400
he played at Tottenham in the final few

1626
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,920
seasons at Tottenham, it's a completely

1627
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:06,920
different player. It's genuinely a

1628
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,920
complete

1629
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:19,520
type of players because Salah's a legend

1630
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:21,280
of the game, but he has to if you're

1631
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,880
Vert, you're a record signing, you have

1632
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:26,160
to walk in there, look Salah in the eye

1633
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:28,880
and be like, "Hey, we're it's a a and yo

1634
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:30,480
a some days I'm a some days you're a but

1635
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:32,079
I don't think he's walked in there with

1636
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:33,839
that at the moment." And now you're

1637
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:36,000
looking at it and I'm like, is he in

1638
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:37,040
Liverpool's best 11 right now?

1639
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,359
>> I wouldn't say so. I look at the

1640
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:41,839
midfield, Shabbos, Mallister, Graham

1641
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:43,520
Burch, and on the left hand side, Gako

1642
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:46,640
has been moved out because they're

1643
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:47,920
trying to incorporate um uh Vertz. And

1644
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,440
you're thinking even in their strongest

1645
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:51,040
team, maybe Akit might be on the left

1646
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:52,640
now or EAC. We they're going to have to

1647
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:54,000
find a way of making that work.

1648
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:56,079
>> But at the moment, I'm thinking off the

1649
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,960
left, no, not really. In the middle, no.

1650
00:50:56,079 --> 00:51:01,680
So now you've got 116 million pound

1651
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:02,880
player that's coming off the bench. But

1652
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,240
You got to commit in that stock. You got

1653
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,359
to commit to that stock for me. So I was

1654
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:07,440
just trying I was just trying to find

1655
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:08,720
someone else there. Like I'm not

1656
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,599
different teams maybe playing slightly

1657
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:11,440
differently.

1658
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:12,000
>> Josh King I was thinking like you know

1659
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,119
he's a 10.

1660
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,400
>> Yeah. Yeah.

1661
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:14,880
>> How many sprints do you think he's

1662
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,400
making?

1663
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,839
>> How much did you say Vert has made?

1664
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:19,680
>> 108.

1665
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:21,920
>> Josh King he kind of runs a lot. I'm

1666
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,880
going to say he's made

1667
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,760
>> 90.

1668
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,880
>> 67.

1669
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,800
>> Wow.

1670
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,119
>> Now look then maybe not got the ball as

1671
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:27,520
much.

1672
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:29,520
>> Yeah.

1673
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:31,280
>> Right. But I I think it's worth I think

1674
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:32,720
it's worth sort of saying. How many's

1675
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:34,480
ech made?

1676
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:36,400
>> Oh,

1677
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:37,119
the Liverpool team 80

1678
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,000
>> 64.

1679
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:40,240
>> Oh man.

1680
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,400
>> So your striker your striker's not doing

1681
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:43,200
that and V is doing 108.

1682
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,640
>> Yeah, that's crazy.

1683
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,200
>> So I think there's something in that. I

1684
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:47,040
really do.

1685
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:48,079
>> And you look at the type player he is.

1686
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:50,480
That's a lot of

1687
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:52,640
>> like he's not powerful. So him having to

1688
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:54,400
sprint that much and it's that could

1689
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,640
affect his game 100%. That could affect

1690
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,160
him.

1691
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:58,079
>> I think it'll come good. Yeah, I'll put

1692
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:59,440
him as will come good. I just don't know

1693
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:00,720
how good the good is, but I'll put him

1694
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,200
as will come good because he's a quality

1695
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,040
player.

1696
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:04,319
>> Yeah, here is we've got them together.

1697
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:05,440
Who who will play more games this

1698
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:07,119
season?

1699
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:09,760
>> Hey Isach, you better watch out. You

1700
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:13,040
know, you better watch out. You better

1701
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:15,760
watch out. Um I

1702
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:18,160
I think they have to make Isach play.

1703
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:20,240
But I was saying, now everyone that

1704
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:23,599
watched my content would know. I was

1705
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:25,520
saying Isak's a huge signing, but it's a

1706
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:27,920
I'm feeling very greedy today, so I'm

1707
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:29,359
just gonna add something on top of my

1708
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:32,079
meal that I don't really need. Do you

1709
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:34,400
know what I mean? And I said by the end

1710
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:36,480
of the season, we could have easily been

1711
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:39,119
speaking about Akitique the way we speak

1712
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:41,839
about Isak. Isak have had two 20 goal

1713
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:43,839
seasons, right, in the Premier League.

1714
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:44,400
>> I think Akitake can do that. I've been

1715
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:46,400
so impressed

1716
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:49,520
>> at the end of the season he could score

1717
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:51,119
25 goals for Liverpool all comps and we

1718
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:54,480
will be speaking about him in the same

1719
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:56,319
breath as Isak qualitywise is there much

1720
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:58,000
difference quality I think there's

1721
00:52:56,319 --> 00:52:59,680
similar levels of quality maybe you

1722
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:03,200
could say Isak is

1723
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:04,400
>> a bit more refined and stuff more out

1724
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,599
feel well certainly with the way they're

1725
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:08,319
playing I could take his players back to

1726
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:09,520
goal a lot more who is complete in a

1727
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:10,480
different way but probably wants to face

1728
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:12,319
the goal a bit more

1729
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:14,160
>> Isak is very good at against the best

1730
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:16,400
center halfs He's given them lots of

1731
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:18,160
trouble. So, Isak is probably the better

1732
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:19,200
player at the moment. By the end of the

1733
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:22,000
season, we could have been speaking

1734
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:24,160
about Ekit like Isak. Now, I do think

1735
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,480
and it's a lovely lovely issue to have,

1736
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:28,800
I guess, but there is a little bit there

1737
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:31,280
will be a little bit I think of a little

1738
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:32,720
bit of issues there because they're

1739
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:36,079
they're both too good to sit on the

1740
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:38,400
bench. Especially how Ekk started firing

1741
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:40,960
before Isa even got his move. He's at

1742
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:42,160
came and he's still firing and then he's

1743
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:45,280
going to have to be like I saw the other

1744
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:48,160
day he scored a brace and then he came

1745
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:49,359
off 67 minutes or something that's

1746
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:51,040
that's removed him from getting a

1747
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:52,319
hat-tick potentially. You know, these

1748
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:55,839
are little things as a striker you're

1749
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:59,359
going to be like keep having to and how

1750
00:53:55,839 --> 00:54:02,000
often in the 4-33 era with a one man up

1751
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:05,920
top. Yeah. Not not not two strikers, one

1752
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:08,800
man up top. Have you had two top

1753
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:10,319
strikers stay at the club together for a

1754
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,680
long time? You don't get it.

1755
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:12,559
>> One of these two will be gone in two

1756
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:14,559
years.

1757
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:15,680
>> One of these two gone two, three years.

1758
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:16,800
>> Just to check it out there, you know,

1759
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:19,440
because we were talking about Verts and

1760
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:20,400
like with the pressure for him to work.

1761
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:23,200
>> Yeah.

1762
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:25,040
>> If Echertica and Vertz don't really kind

1763
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,800
of find a flow together as a pairing

1764
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:29,760
because it feels like Vert is being like

1765
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:33,200
quite sacrificial with all of it. Isach

1766
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:34,160
might if to it's maybe an easier life if

1767
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,920
you

1768
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:38,240
>> move ech aside

1769
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:40,160
>> to allow Isach to play more as like an

1770
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:42,720
out andout striker and then you give

1771
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:44,880
verts that space to go and do that. So

1772
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:45,680
that might make life difficult for ek

1773
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:46,319
but if he's playing too good he's

1774
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:48,319
playing too good.

1775
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:50,400
>> Yeah that affects but then that affects

1776
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:51,760
like a mallistister or a shabosi and

1777
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,319
then all of a sudden the balance of the

1778
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,839
team

1779
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:56,240
>> which will go is a little bit of a

1780
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:57,440
headache. Which one will go?

1781
00:54:56,240 --> 00:55:01,040
>> Which one? Okay. Which one of those

1782
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:02,319
three were the first to leave the club?

1783
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,720
>> Ekit.

1784
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:04,880
>> Yeah,

1785
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:06,960
>> cuz I think he's going to do well.

1786
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:10,160
>> Yes. I think he's going to do so well,

1787
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:12,240
but always because of the fee and

1788
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:14,160
because of who Isizak is, might not get

1789
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:16,160
the nod. And then there's going to be a

1790
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:17,599
big team like a Barcelona who are

1791
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:20,400
looking for strikers. There's going to

1792
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:21,119
be a team is I mean Ekit will just take

1793
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,280
him.

1794
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:25,200
>> There we go. So, and that's all three

1795
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:26,720
are quality players, but I think you

1796
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,480
this is what happens with squads, you

1797
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:30,960
know? It's just what happens. Like, it's

1798
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:33,280
okay to have Erling Harland if your

1799
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:35,839
second striker is Jesus. No disrespect.

1800
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:37,760
It's okay to have this. Yeah, but but

1801
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:40,000
these two I'm telling you, Ekkit can

1802
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:41,760
look this guy in the eye and it's going

1803
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,280
to and that's not that's not good, you

1804
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,720
know? It's not a good thing. Like,

1805
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:46,079
Alvarez, look what happened with him.

1806
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:47,359
Like,

1807
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:48,559
>> said this to me. He said, "When like

1808
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:50,640
every every year you like there'd be

1809
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:53,119
free strikers and like I hate you."

1810
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:54,799
>> Yeah. You I Well, I'm worried about you

1811
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:56,880
two cuz you're trying to take my spot.

1812
00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:58,000
>> The third choice is like he hates him

1813
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,839
because he wants the second spot so he

1814
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:02,400
can get close to me. You hate me like

1815
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:04,400
>> Yeah. And Alvarez, Julian Alvarez at Man

1816
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:06,000
City, he got to a point where it's like

1817
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,599
he's too good just to be some sub

1818
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,640
player. Athletic just sniffed that

1819
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:09,839
straight away.

1820
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:12,400
>> Thank you very much. And I think that's

1821
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:14,160
what could happen. Milos Kirk nine

1822
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:16,960
appearances,

1823
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:23,359
>> n uh 0.73 crosses into the penalty area

1824
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:25,760
in 2425, 0.2 two in 25 26 I

1825
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:26,319
>> I'm not sure they're having him you know

1826
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:29,119
but

1827
00:56:26,319 --> 00:56:32,319
>> he what's really unfair on KZ

1828
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:35,520
>> what's really unfair on KZ is

1829
00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:36,880
Arlaw and this is and Arnos manager he

1830
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:38,319
needs to win the game so that's all he's

1831
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:40,400
got to do right it's fine

1832
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:42,720
>> but he is playing him a lot more narrow

1833
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:44,880
or he he goes up and pretends he's being

1834
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:46,079
a 10 but the whole every person on that

1835
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:48,319
pitch knows they're never going to pass

1836
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:50,319
the ball to him and and Kirk himself his

1837
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:52,160
body language. He's going

1838
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:52,880
>> pointing at the other guy, so you don't

1839
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:54,240
want the ball.

1840
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:56,880
>> Yeah.

1841
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:58,799
>> And that's not the best of Kirk, right?

1842
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:00,720
>> The best of Kirk was him being dynamic

1843
00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:02,640
and everyone was raving about him.

1844
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:03,280
Defensively, he's a little bit erratic.

1845
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:05,920
>> Very

1846
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,960
>> right. But in terms of getting back, he

1847
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,079
can do that. He's got, you know, he's

1848
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:10,480
obviously physically more impressive

1849
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:13,200
than Andy Robertson right now. But I was

1850
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:15,280
watching the game against Palace and and

1851
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:17,920
he's like when he Yeah. when they have

1852
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:19,680
got the ball, he either got out the way

1853
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:20,799
so Mallister could drop in and get the

1854
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:23,520
ball

1855
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:24,400
>> or he was kind of there in a really safe

1856
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:26,000
place.

1857
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:28,640
>> So either way, you're not getting the

1858
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:32,079
best version of Kirk. Now, is that

1859
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:33,440
>> is that a problem broadly? No. You know,

1860
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:34,160
Liverpool's still been winning winning

1861
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:36,160
games,

1862
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:38,000
>> but if you've bought Kirz and you want

1863
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:38,559
the bulm, you're not you're not going to

1864
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,040
get him.

1865
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:44,880
>> Yeah. And I think that's a problem for

1866
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:46,400
the uh the optics of Kirz. I also there

1867
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:47,680
are moments where and maybe it's just

1868
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:49,119
this one game and I was looking at I

1869
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:50,960
sort of saw it and I was like I feel

1870
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:52,559
like I'm seeing something here.

1871
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:54,000
>> They didn't want to pass to him. It

1872
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:56,000
didn't feel like or sorry it wasn't

1873
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,440
that. It was more like

1874
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,960
>> it was more like this sounds really

1875
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:01,359
harsh but it's like why would I pass to

1876
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:02,000
you when Mallister's there or it was

1877
00:58:01,359 --> 00:58:02,880
more that

1878
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,920
>> Yeah.

1879
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:05,599
>> And um

1880
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:06,880
>> and I don't know. I don't know.

1881
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:09,200
>> Respecting these I'm going to put not

1882
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:11,280
quite feeling. I don't like the start.

1883
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:12,720
Um I still think at this point I don't

1884
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:15,119
know. I think Robinson might still be

1885
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:16,480
the best better left back at this point.

1886
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:18,640
So I wonder if

1887
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:20,160
>> I'm not sure but maybe it's a bad just a

1888
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:22,240
rough start but

1889
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:24,880
>> I'm not I'm not feeling it. I'm afraid

1890
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:27,359
and I do wonder the one thing also when

1891
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:29,359
Fong comes see that's the thing I think

1892
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:30,480
about next year you think at some point

1893
00:58:29,359 --> 00:58:33,760
Salah will go.

1894
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:35,520
>> Yeah. and Frim Pong will take that space

1895
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:37,760
and that might you know alleviate a lot

1896
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:40,400
of these different things. I also wonder

1897
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:43,040
if you bring in a if you have Mark Gay

1898
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:45,839
and Van Djk there is that one where you

1899
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:47,440
go okay we're right you can go now

1900
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:48,720
>> so that the fullback's a little bit more

1901
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,680
and that might lead to something because

1902
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:51,040
there's definitely moments where you'd

1903
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,440
go on go.

1904
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:54,559
>> Yeah

1905
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:55,839
>> and uh he's not and I feel like that

1906
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:57,200
there's a reason for that. I think he's

1907
00:58:55,839 --> 00:58:58,640
you know abiding instructions.

1908
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:01,599
>> I feel for Liverpool's fullbacks. They

1909
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:03,839
had two legendary fullbacks in Brao and

1910
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:05,520
Trent who were the system under Klo in

1911
00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:07,760
their best years. Those two were the

1912
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:09,520
system. Like the midfield three, you

1913
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:12,640
guys were literally there to basically

1914
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:14,480
cover spaces for them to to get forward

1915
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:17,599
and they were putting record numbers of

1916
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:20,079
assists up and stuff like that. So now

1917
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:22,799
you go to these guys who are not

1918
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:23,680
legendary players. Fong and and Kirz,

1919
00:59:22,799 --> 00:59:26,319
it's a

1920
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:27,599
>> it maybe can be seen as a a downgrade,

1921
00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:29,280
which is

1922
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:31,040
>> so different, aren't they? I do I think

1923
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:33,440
I'm wrong about Fong. I said something

1924
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:36,000
about like he'd be a bit of a flop about

1925
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:37,520
I I think I'd change my mind cuz I think

1926
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,319
I think he's exciting once he's on the

1927
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:41,119
pitch. Do you know what I mean?

1928
00:59:38,319 --> 00:59:43,200
>> I guess so. I haven't really seen too

1929
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:43,520
much yet, but I like Ring Pong to be

1930
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,119
fair.

1931
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:47,920
>> We'll do a few more and then we'll do a

1932
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:49,680
quick fire bunch if that's okay. So, uh

1933
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:51,599
I mean this might be an easy quick one.

1934
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:53,440
Uh Rinders.

1935
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:55,280
>> Oh yeah, huge

1936
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:57,200
>> proper player. Proper player Rind is in

1937
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:58,480
it. And the thing is his engine is very

1938
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:00,000
underrated as well. I didn't know he had

1939
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:01,920
an engine like that. I knew he was a

1940
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,680
very good player. Got an eye for goal.

1941
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:05,440
His engine he gets about man. He

1942
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:07,440
>> and it's like a quiet like it's quite

1943
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:09,440
electric car you know. He's just going

1944
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:12,079
>> but it's not it's some players you watch

1945
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:13,280
you see him run and you can hear the

1946
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:14,720
>> he's not really it's like one of those

1947
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:17,200
quiet ones.

1948
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:19,839
>> He's Yeah, he's

1949
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:21,440
>> um Brian and Burmo

1950
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:21,920
>> will come good.

1951
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:22,240
>> Yeah.

1952
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,280
>> Yes.

1953
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:24,079
>> Cuz yeah, I wanted to get your take on

1954
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:25,760
the Man United guys.

1955
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:28,240
>> He will come good. I I I really like

1956
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:30,000
Embuo, but you know with the Amarim

1957
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:31,440
situation, I'm not liking the positions

1958
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,520
that he's taking up on the pitch. He's

1959
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:36,240
nowhere near close enough to goal, which

1960
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:37,760
is really annoying because when he was

1961
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:39,520
at Brenford, he was close to goal. When

1962
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:41,599
you look at with Ivan Tony or with

1963
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:43,520
Whissa, that's why they had this great

1964
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:45,359
one-two punch and now we've just got him

1965
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:48,160
on the touch line, which he's meant to

1966
01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:49,440
be in the 10, but he's not a 10. And

1967
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:52,799
then we've got him on the touch line

1968
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:54,079
just spamming crosses to only one man in

1969
01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:56,000
the box. We only have one man in box

1970
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:58,160
with Cesco. So he's looking pretty

1971
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:01,440
wasteful but I believe in him. I think

1972
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:02,960
he's a good player. So he will come and

1973
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:03,520
I know Kuna is the next one.

1974
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:05,680
>> Yep.

1975
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:07,440
>> He's in the exact same boat for me. Kuna

1976
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:09,760
I'm a little bit a little bit more

1977
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:13,839
concerned than I am with Embumo because

1978
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:15,200
Kuna has given me as I said hero of a

1979
01:01:13,839 --> 01:01:17,119
slow you know when they say big fish

1980
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:18,400
small pond I don't look at Embumo like

1981
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:20,000
that. I look at him as a you can plug

1982
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:21,920
and play him. I can imagine him going

1983
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:24,079
into Liverpool Arsenal plug and play

1984
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:25,920
type player. But I look at Kuna and I

1985
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:27,200
think are you a are you the system type

1986
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:30,559
player? Like are you the player that

1987
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:32,319
needs the system around you? And that's

1988
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:33,599
where I'm kind of like are you ever

1989
01:01:32,319 --> 01:01:34,720
going to have that at Man United? Kind

1990
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:36,240
of just what you're saying about Verts.

1991
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:38,640
Are you going to have that? Now you're a

1992
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:40,480
quality player with Bruno about and just

1993
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:41,520
in general like so I'm looking at and

1994
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:43,200
I'm thinking

1995
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:45,680
>> to get that you're going to have to come

1996
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:47,280
in and do massive things. So instantly

1997
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:49,760
we're like okay this needs to be Kuna's

1998
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:51,440
team and right now hasn't been the way

1999
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:52,799
so far but he's a quality player. So,

2000
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:54,400
I'm going to say will come good as well,

2001
01:01:52,799 --> 01:01:55,920
but I have a little bit more concern

2002
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:58,079
than I do formo.

2003
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:01,040
>> Yeah, I I agree on both. Maybe even huge

2004
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:02,960
for uh is itumo? I was going

2005
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:04,319
>> I used to say Bumo, right? And everyone

2006
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:06,000
started saying I was saying it wrong and

2007
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:07,119
then he did a thing and he said his name

2008
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,359
was Umbumo.

2009
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:09,680
>> Yeah,

2010
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:11,920
>> Impumo at the Premier League. I swear I

2011
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:12,480
got told it was in Burma. So, I shook

2012
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:13,599
out Burma.

2013
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:13,839
>> That's what I'm saying. I don't know,

2014
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:15,440
man.

2015
01:02:13,839 --> 01:02:16,720
>> I think he could be huge cuz I think his

2016
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:18,960
goals might keep him up.

2017
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:20,960
>> Who's

2018
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:23,839
you want to call it? Brian,

2019
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:25,200
>> honestly could if he gets that bad. Uh

2020
01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:26,880
>> Nick Volultard,

2021
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:28,480
>> I like him. You know,

2022
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:30,720
>> new Crouchy.

2023
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:32,799
>> Got the touch of crouch. He's got the

2024
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:34,160
silk.

2025
01:02:32,799 --> 01:02:35,839
>> 23, man. Great.

2026
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:37,040
>> I like him, you know. I like him. And

2027
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:38,559
you know what? I'm going to say huge.

2028
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:40,160
You know what I'm going to say? Huge.

2029
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:43,119
>> Now, I don't hope Man United fans don't

2030
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:44,880
think I'm not saying that Kuna and Buma

2031
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:46,559
are huge players. They are huge players,

2032
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:48,000
but I think we're so bad right now. So,

2033
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:51,040
I need to say we'll come good. Anyway,

2034
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:53,040
back to Volt Mada, right? I think he's

2035
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:55,920
going to be a huge sign and because of

2036
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:58,000
the context as well, I think losing

2037
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:58,480
Isach was like that must have been

2038
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,599
deflated.

2039
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:00,400
>> He's hit the ground running. That's

2040
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:02,079
crucial, don't they?

2041
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:03,040
>> Yes. But I think he's going to kind of

2042
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:05,280
just

2043
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:07,200
>> Hey, life is not so doom and gloom

2044
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:09,040
without Isach. You know, Vissa will come

2045
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:10,400
back. He'll run a little big man's

2046
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:12,799
little man thing. You know, we used to

2047
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:14,480
see it back in Defo and Crouchy. Hey,

2048
01:03:12,799 --> 01:03:17,119
run it back, man. You know, Eddie How,

2049
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:19,119
man. Hey, run it back. So, I I like the

2050
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:20,720
signing. I'm going to say I'm going to

2051
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:23,359
say it's going to be a huge signing.

2052
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:25,599
>> Okay. And the last one on United, uh

2053
01:03:23,359 --> 01:03:27,839
Ses,

2054
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:29,359
>> what I It's been hard, man, considering

2055
01:03:27,839 --> 01:03:30,400
you were like waiting to see him and now

2056
01:03:29,359 --> 01:03:32,240
you're starting to see him.

2057
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:33,920
>> Yeah. It's s I actually looking at him

2058
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:35,839
and I'm like, "Okay, in a few of your

2059
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:38,000
moments, you look good. Like, I'm seeing

2060
01:03:35,839 --> 01:03:40,079
your touches are are decent. You're

2061
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,520
working the back four. You're not going

2062
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:42,480
to get any service." The thing about it

2063
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:44,240
is that you're going to have to create

2064
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:46,000
your own goals at Man United. Honestly,

2065
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:48,000
like the the difference with him and

2066
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,680
Hyland is that he actually can control

2067
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,760
the like Hyand was not controlling the

2068
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:53,520
ball. He was battling and losing out.

2069
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:55,200
Cesco, I saw like he won his flick on

2070
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:58,480
against Chelsea. He's like he's a bit

2071
01:03:55,200 --> 01:04:00,640
more of a presence. So, I like him. But

2072
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:03,599
honestly, with Man United number nine, I

2073
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:04,960
can never ever predict it. It's like I

2074
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:07,119
don't I wish there was another section

2075
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:07,440
where you could just say like unknown.

2076
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:10,000
>> Yeah,

2077
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:11,039
>> cuz like

2078
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,640
I don't know.

2079
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:14,240
>> You're scared. I

2080
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:15,039
>> I'm going to say he's going to will come

2081
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:15,440
good.

2082
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:17,440
>> Yeah.

2083
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:17,920
>> In the imagination that we get a new

2084
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:19,119
manager.

2085
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,440
>> I think he'll come good, mate. Don't

2086
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:20,640
worry.

2087
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:22,240
>> Yeah, I think you're right. I think he's

2088
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:23,440
got everything you need. Yeah. All

2089
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:23,920
right. Let's do quicker.

2090
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:25,200
>> Yes.

2091
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:25,680
>> Okay. Ready?

2092
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:28,880
>> Yes.

2093
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:33,160
>> Dan and Doy.

2094
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:33,160
>> This is a This is a Forest

2095
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:39,920
>> will come good.

2096
01:04:38,319 --> 01:04:40,799
>> I see. I think huge. I think I think

2097
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:41,920
they've done well there. I don't think

2098
01:04:40,799 --> 01:04:42,960
they've actually dropped off at all. I

2099
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:44,160
think he's as good as Alanganger

2100
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:46,000
actually the more I think about it.

2101
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:47,599
Hhabib Diara don't if you see much of

2102
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,880
him Sunderland

2103
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:50,480
>> I haven't seen too much.

2104
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:51,599
>> He will.

2105
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:52,480
>> People have been talking about him a lot

2106
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:52,799
I think this year.

2107
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:54,480
>> Okay.

2108
01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:56,480
>> The one thing he does and this is where

2109
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:58,240
I disagree with me and Kai disagree with

2110
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:59,200
him. He shoots a lot

2111
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:00,480
>> really

2112
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:01,760
>> and I think that could lead to a couple

2113
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:03,280
of like bangers and it will work for you

2114
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:05,280
and it'll be fine but sometimes it's

2115
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:06,880
like you don't need to always shoot. You

2116
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:07,920
know what player remember was like that

2117
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:09,039
QPR

2118
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:10,240
>> who'd always shoot

2119
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:12,079
>> in the Premier League

2120
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:14,400
>> in the Prem. Christ

2121
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:17,440
>> always true and you're like what are you

2122
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:19,920
doing but then he caught one banger one

2123
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:22,920
time and I was like FZ who

2124
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:22,920
>> danger

2125
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:27,039
against Arsenal

2126
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:28,720
>> bro he would shoot and you're like you

2127
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:30,880
haven't got the tech for it why are you

2128
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:32,640
shooting like his light eyes will light

2129
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:35,520
up at any shooting opportunity you know

2130
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:37,440
when fans say shoot he took it literally

2131
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:39,280
but then yeah he got that finally he

2132
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:41,760
finally got that banger

2133
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:43,599
>> um so D I think I think He's huge and

2134
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:45,039
he's both of these are huge but that's

2135
01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:46,240
what they they they sort of sing

2136
01:05:45,039 --> 01:05:48,319
together for me.

2137
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:51,440
>> Diara Granite Jhaka

2138
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:52,559
>> he they're building it's built around

2139
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:53,839
him with the profiles around him that

2140
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:55,119
will work for him that provide the legs

2141
01:05:53,839 --> 01:05:56,640
that he need. He just needs to be smart

2142
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:58,400
on the ball and god he is.

2143
01:05:56,640 --> 01:06:00,319
>> Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to watch out for

2144
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:00,720
him now. I'm going to keep attention.

2145
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:02,720
Yeah.

2146
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:04,319
>> Robin as well is another one. Uh he's

2147
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:07,920
the goalkeeper had a great start to the

2148
01:06:04,319 --> 01:06:09,280
season as well. Uh and and and um yeah

2149
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:10,880
won't will come good. He's come good

2150
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:12,640
already. Jia,

2151
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:13,760
>> did you say Granite Shaka?

2152
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:14,960
>> I had said Granite Shaka.

2153
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:15,280
>> Oh, that's my favorite sign in the

2154
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:16,000
summer.

2155
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:17,119
>> Is it?

2156
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,920
>> That is the one that I said.

2157
01:06:17,119 --> 01:06:18,720
>> What's the difference between him and

2158
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:20,160
Endo?

2159
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:22,079
>> And who?

2160
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:24,319
>> Naka

2161
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:26,480
has got more quality for me. Shaka, that

2162
01:06:24,319 --> 01:06:28,559
is the signing of the season. I'm

2163
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:30,799
telling you, I loved it from the minute

2164
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:32,880
it happened. The type of player he is,

2165
01:06:30,799 --> 01:06:35,200
warrior, absolute warrior, leader,

2166
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:37,599
experience, got on ball quality as well,

2167
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:40,319
which he's shown already. He got some

2168
01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:41,200
clutch assists. This guy is a is I

2169
01:06:40,319 --> 01:06:43,280
always thought he's a really good

2170
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:45,200
player. I've always loved Shaka and for

2171
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:47,359
him to walk in I love that Sunland

2172
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:49,599
instantly just said here's the armband.

2173
01:06:47,359 --> 01:06:52,720
We're not wasting any time. Take it take

2174
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:54,880
us to the promised land as well. Arsenal

2175
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:57,200
said you know Arsenal said he can do it.

2176
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:58,640
>> Instantly going to be like it I I I said

2177
01:06:57,200 --> 01:07:00,960
at the start of season

2178
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:02,799
>> he it's going to take one to three games

2179
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:05,359
for him to be a cult hero at Sunderland

2180
01:07:02,799 --> 01:07:07,839
and it's happened already for me. I've

2181
01:07:05,359 --> 01:07:09,280
got two signings that I absolutely love

2182
01:07:07,839 --> 01:07:10,559
and he's that's that's one of them.

2183
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:13,200
>> Okay, let's see if there's one of the

2184
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:14,559
other ones. Jia,

2185
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:16,640
>> uh I think it's a good signing. Not

2186
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:20,799
huge, but we'll come good.

2187
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:22,640
>> Semi feeling it. Javi Simmons,

2188
01:07:20,799 --> 01:07:24,000
>> I don't know if this one. It's Techi,

2189
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:25,359
but he's been looking all right. He

2190
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,440
looked all right, and he was terrible

2191
01:07:25,359 --> 01:07:28,640
against um who was the last game they

2192
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:29,359
played, the 1-1.

2193
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:31,599
>> Uh Wolves.

2194
01:07:29,359 --> 01:07:33,440
>> Wolves. Yeah, I'm going to say will come

2195
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:35,200
good, but I don't think his level is

2196
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:38,400
going to be like unbelievable. I think

2197
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:40,240
it's just going to be a good player like

2198
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:40,559
Madison was good in it. He was good.

2199
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:43,520
Yeah.

2200
01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:44,640
>> Okay. Kudos

2201
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:45,680
>> will come good.

2202
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:47,920
>> I think huge.

2203
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:48,319
>> Huge. No, no, you could huge.

2204
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:48,799
>> Yeah,

2205
01:07:48,319 --> 01:07:51,280
>> huge.

2206
01:07:48,799 --> 01:07:52,720
>> I get sort of like you're waiting for

2207
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:53,599
him to grab his career.

2208
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:56,000
>> Yeah, exactly.

2209
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:58,240
>> Uh Elaz Malik Jof,

2210
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,960
>> my favorite signing. That's the next Is

2211
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:00,319
that the other one?

2212
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:01,680
>> That's the next one.

2213
01:08:00,319 --> 01:08:02,079
>> What a player, man.

2214
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:03,839
>> Yeah,

2215
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:04,960
>> this guy is proper. I don't care. This

2216
01:08:03,839 --> 01:08:06,400
is one and done.

2217
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:07,119
>> This is one and done, James.

2218
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:09,119
>> What do you mean?

2219
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:10,000
>> One and done in terms of He will not be

2220
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:10,480
at West Ham next season.

2221
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,640
>> Oh, okay.

2222
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:14,480
>> One and done. He can play for everybody.

2223
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:17,679
>> I love the way he hits a cross.

2224
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:19,759
>> His bro, has he got the his whips are

2225
01:08:17,679 --> 01:08:21,679
unbelievable. And I saw it against

2226
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:22,960
England against Senagal England. And I

2227
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:24,080
was like, who is this left back? He

2228
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:26,640
looks unbelievable. One of my friends

2229
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:28,480
like, yeah, Joff, he's gone to West Ham.

2230
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:30,799
So I was like, "Okay, that's going to be

2231
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:32,319
my one to watch signing of the season."

2232
01:08:30,799 --> 01:08:33,600
And already he's showing what he can do.

2233
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:35,520
Honestly, he looks above West Ham's

2234
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:37,839
level. You look at Man City right now,

2235
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:40,480
they got Nori, he's okay. He's good.

2236
01:08:37,839 --> 01:08:42,560
Yeah. You look at United, Duo. He's he's

2237
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:44,159
all right. You look at these teams, Kirk

2238
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:45,359
was just talking about, he can play for

2239
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:49,199
anybody, I think.

2240
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:50,480
>> Player, man. 20

2241
01:08:49,199 --> 01:08:51,600
and what Senagal are going to have a

2242
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:53,359
great World Cup as well. So,

2243
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:54,719
>> okay. Lots of predictions there. Uh, and

2244
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:57,040
that's the end of it.

2245
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:58,560
>> Great work. Well done. We've judged

2246
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:59,279
enough people now, haven't we? I think

2247
01:08:58,560 --> 01:08:59,759
enough's enough.

2248
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:00,960
>> One more.

2249
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:02,080
>> Oh, you got one more. Go and chuck it.

2250
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:02,799
>> Ryan Shy,

2251
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:03,679
>> of course. Yeah.

2252
01:09:02,799 --> 01:09:04,159
>> Will come good.

2253
01:09:03,679 --> 01:09:05,199
>> Yeah.

2254
01:09:04,159 --> 01:09:07,679
>> Watch.

2255
01:09:05,199 --> 01:09:08,159
>> I got a lot of the line for that one. We

2256
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:10,000
got

2257
01:09:08,159 --> 01:09:12,000
>> Is he your boy or is he his boy first?

2258
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:14,560
>> So, Leah had the Algerian connection.

2259
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:17,040
So, that was his boy from like from day

2260
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:18,080
one. But then like when I saw Shery, I

2261
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:19,759
just fell in love with this guy.

2262
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:21,279
Honestly, I've got a lot right. If he

2263
01:09:19,759 --> 01:09:24,560
flops, yo, I might have to go into

2264
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:27,359
hiding. You know that. Yo, I think it

2265
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:28,719
Again, it's one is he you're not going

2266
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:29,440
to build the systems around him though,

2267
01:09:28,719 --> 01:09:30,960
are they?

2268
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:32,560
>> They're not. They won't. Man City won't

2269
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:35,279
do that. They do that. So, he'll have to

2270
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:35,839
find a way. But he is so talented. It's

2271
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:37,759
just

2272
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:40,480
>> he he makes you enjoy watching football.

2273
01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:42,239
>> Oh my god, bro. Like, he is just he's so

2274
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:45,040
special. So, I just hope it works out.

2275
01:09:42,239 --> 01:09:47,199
>> Me and Le joke about this like we joke

2276
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:48,799
about this phrase. It's called a court

2277
01:09:47,199 --> 01:09:49,679
to lose, which means lights out. She's

2278
01:09:48,799 --> 01:09:49,920
basically a dummy.

2279
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:51,359
>> Okay.

2280
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:52,880
>> Right. And so when you're talking about

2281
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:55,360
like relationism, right, when you hear

2282
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:57,199
that sort of spoken, the quarter lo is

2283
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:59,040
used a lot because if you're sort of

2284
01:09:57,199 --> 01:10:00,960
coming and defending, if the pass is

2285
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:02,159
coming here and you def the defender has

2286
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:04,159
to come to you.

2287
01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:05,600
>> But if you just leave the ball and it

2288
01:10:04,159 --> 01:10:06,640
goes behind you, that player's out, but

2289
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:08,480
that player had to come to you because

2290
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:10,159
what if you touch it, then you've not,

2291
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:11,920
you know, you're not tight enough. So a

2292
01:10:10,159 --> 01:10:13,360
quarter is a really powerful thing that

2293
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:14,880
I don't think people use enough in in

2294
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:17,920
modern football. So when you kind of see

2295
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:20,480
it, you're like like and um and Ryan

2296
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:22,239
Chery loves it. So whenever I see one or

2297
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:23,520
whenever I see one with Ryan Chuggy in

2298
01:10:22,239 --> 01:10:25,120
particular cuz he did a couple in the

2299
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:26,719
Club World Cup when we were doing it for

2300
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:29,280
Dar

2301
01:10:26,719 --> 01:10:30,719
I'll always just send it to him but he

2302
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:32,080
loves it especially with Harland. He

2303
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:34,719
loves a little like little dummy.

2304
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:36,800
>> Oh he he's such a But honestly though

2305
01:10:34,719 --> 01:10:38,400
listen let him get back from his injury.

2306
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:40,080
I hate when my favorite players play for

2307
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:42,880
the rivals but

2308
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:43,840
>> hey it is what it is. Turkey we got a

2309
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:44,800
lot riding for you mate.

2310
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:46,159
>> Lots of players will come good. That's

2311
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:47,280
the positivity we're trying to put out.

2312
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:48,400
So good luck to everyone. We didn't say

2313
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:49,760
no refund, did we?

2314
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:50,640
>> No, we didn't. Cuz I don't think we were

2315
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:52,320
able to get a full refund on

2316
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:53,679
>> certain refund on anyone that I'm

2317
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:56,640
thinking of. Have you got any refunds on

2318
01:10:53,679 --> 01:10:58,080
M? That wasn't on the list.

2319
01:10:56,640 --> 01:11:00,159
>> Refunds.

2320
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:01,920
>> The only one. Yeah, I guess Pellini have

2321
01:11:00,159 --> 01:11:03,679
not bought him, have you? It's just a

2322
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:05,520
loan. So that's So that is you can get a

2323
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:07,679
solid refund there. Um because it's not

2324
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:09,440
cost you anything. Um I don't know ones

2325
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:12,560
that you're not There's a few that

2326
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:14,960
>> refund. Refund one.

2327
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:17,520
>> Who's in the league at the moment?

2328
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:17,920
>> I do. I want Yakarez to do well. You

2329
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:19,120
just

2330
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:20,960
>> you put him in the refund.

2331
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:22,880
>> No, but like you just sort of wonder a

2332
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:25,199
little bit, don't you? You do wonder,

2333
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:26,400
but I think it's an aesthetic thing.

2334
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:27,440
>> I think that's the big thing here.

2335
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:30,560
Right. Here we go.

2336
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:32,480
>> These are the 10 top 10 this summer.

2337
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:34,000
>> Which one do you need? Would you if you

2338
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:35,520
if you had to get a refund from one of

2339
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,880
these? Okay, you could get a refund and

2340
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:39,760
it doesn't exist. That transfer's done.

2341
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:40,719
All right. All right. Yarez, Dubendi,

2342
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:41,760
>> Ez,

2343
01:11:40,719 --> 01:11:43,280
>> Kuna,

2344
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:44,800
>> Voltoada,

2345
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:46,000
and Bumo,

2346
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,960
>> Bumo,

2347
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,280
>> Seso.

2348
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:50,280
>> Mhm.

2349
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:50,280
>> Ech,

2350
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:58,960
you might be a good dude. You know,

2351
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:00,800
>> you were a good dude, but that's a

2352
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:03,840
that's a that was a British record

2353
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:07,679
transfer. Could Liverpool reinvest that

2354
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:10,400
money? Is Vert gonna be 116 million

2355
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:11,760
pound signing?

2356
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:13,280
>> When do you need to get the payoff?

2357
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:15,120
That's the question. If you've got five

2358
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:16,159
years to get the payoff,

2359
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:17,920
>> I'm not so sure.

2360
01:12:16,159 --> 01:12:20,159
>> Not so sure.

2361
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:21,440
>> I got to go for the most pricey pricey

2362
01:12:20,159 --> 01:12:22,800
ones, you know. So,

2363
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:24,640
>> verse.

2364
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:25,679
>> Yeah, cuz I think Isak is going to be

2365
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:27,280
still be special.

2366
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:29,840
>> I think mine's Yokarez, you know.

2367
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:32,239
>> Yarez is Yakist.

2368
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:33,199
>> Yeah. Sorry. I am struggling with the
