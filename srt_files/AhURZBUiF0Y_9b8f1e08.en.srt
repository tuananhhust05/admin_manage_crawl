1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:04,799
Right then people, welcome back to the

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:06,799
more James Orcot channel with me, Moore.

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,160
Let's talk about this England squad. Uh

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,519
Jude Bellingham has been left out.

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,040
That's the top headline, but actually

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,759
it's the subplots under that that I

7
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,440
think are far more I mean somewhat

8
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,680
confusing, but I kind of understand the

9
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,560
road that Tulle's going down here. The

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,640
big changes or I guess the yeah the

11
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,880
emissions are Jack Greish isn't

12
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,880
involved, Phil Foden is involved and

13
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,480
Jude Bellingham doesn't make it into

14
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,240
this squad as well. In terms of the

15
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,399
changes, Tukul's gone. I wanted to

16
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,920
invite everyone. Uh I watched his press

17
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,079
conference and and he was kind of big on

18
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,320
a few things that and kind of the the

19
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:41,520
team spirit that was apparently fostered

20
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,879
in that f in that last uh camp and he

21
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,120
wanted to kind of stick with that which

22
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:48,239
I think is really really interesting. So

23
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:51,200
Quanza is in which is maybe a bit of a

24
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,840
maybe a slight shock to some but he was

25
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,640
in the last one. Um Loft Chic replaced

26
00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:00,000
Adam Walton. I'll come back to that. um

27
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,000
he replaced him in the last squad and

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,159
has retained his place. I think Walter

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,880
might got injured prior to that or or in

30
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,799
that moment. And Saka has come back in.

31
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,000
Madaweki's got injured. So sadly he's

32
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,760
kind of had to make his way out. And

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,080
Tino Livernto is not there. So a bit

34
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,600
lower on right backs, but you got Jed

35
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,640
Spence who can play right back or left

36
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,880
back. So he's not really got a problem

37
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,159
there. Kza, if you had to go and do it,

38
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,840
he could do that as well. So it'll be

39
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,280
interesting to see who he goes for in

40
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,640
the Wales game and the Latvia game

41
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,320
because the Latvia game thing to

42
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,600
remember with the Latvia game and this

43
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,640
is where it kind of leads onto the Dub

44
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,159
Bellingham situation is that with Jude

45
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,600
Bellingham

46
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:39,759
not being in this squad it is quite the

47
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:42,799
comment and I think it's deliberate um

48
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:45,360
and I think it's down to group dynamics

49
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,960
because and I think this could cause a

50
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,600
bit of a problem down the road but right

51
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,360
now I think it's a smart call. I think

52
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,159
Jude Bellingham is clearly a very very

53
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,079
high-profile person within the squad and

54
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,000
I love him. I absolutely love him and

55
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:01,600
you obviously want him in that squad as

56
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,640
well. But I think in terms of that group

57
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,880
valuing themselves and and really kind

58
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,679
of understanding like what they're about

59
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:13,120
like and and being important to the

60
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,800
team. I think Jude Bellingham does, you

61
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,239
know, if he wants to or not, I don't

62
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,879
think he means to do it. I think he does

63
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:21,920
take a lot of the spotlight, right?

64
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:24,959
So, I think to give this group their

65
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,640
moment on their own and to go and if

66
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,239
they beat Latvia get to the World Cup

67
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,160
themselves, that is a moment that this

68
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,160
group will have on its own and that will

69
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,480
bond them pretty tightly and I think it

70
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,200
will allow them to have um sort of

71
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,680
greater status individually amongst this

72
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,440
group without the sort of noise of of

73
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,760
Jude Bellingham. And by the way, this is

74
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,200
the JLA tactics board. So, there's so

75
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,519
many different great things you can do

76
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,959
to take your analysis to the next level.

77
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,480
A million different things here which I

78
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,599
can chuck on now, but I've got a whole

79
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,440
video on the channel that breaks it

80
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,120
down. And we've got a new addition, a

81
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,280
couple of new additions to it in terms

82
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,840
of how you can just like pick up the

83
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,879
whole squad. Oh, how you can pick up the

84
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,959
whole squad really easily and move them

85
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,720
about. You can switch sides now. It's

86
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,360
never been easier. So, if you want to

87
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,720
get involved, please do. Link is in the

88
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,400
description. Also, if you're a coach,

89
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,720
we've now got equipment that you can put

90
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,360
in as well. All sorts of different kind

91
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,360
of equipment and stuff like that. Um, so

92
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:24,400
definitely worth having a look at if you

93
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:25,760
are in the mood for it. So, um,

94
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,120
the thing with the group dynamics though

95
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,319
with Bellingham, so Bellingham, there's

96
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,680
two sides of it, right? There's this

97
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,879
group being left alone without Jude

98
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,560
Bellingham in it. And again, I'm not

99
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,640
saying Jude Bellingham's a problem, but

100
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm saying he's a big big personality.

101
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:40,000
The other thing for me is

102
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,159
is is Jude Bellingham and how he will

103
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,840
feel. He won't be an outsider when he

104
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,400
comes back, but he will have kind of

105
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,360
missed something. So, his status will

106
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,400
have dropped just a little bit. And I I

107
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,440
don't think that's the worst thing. I

108
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,440
don't think that's the worst thing in

109
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,799
terms of humbling.

110
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,239
It's not I don't it's not about humbling

111
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,959
Jub Bellingham but like I think just

112
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:04,560
kind of taking down the temperature on

113
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,319
his um kind of importance in this group

114
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,680
because that could happen. You know, you

115
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,360
could get to the World Cup and he could

116
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,680
get an injury. Like this is England.

117
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,400
We've seen this several times. So I

118
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,920
don't I don't dislike that at all. Um

119
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,759
it's also never a great time to say that

120
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,840
we're going to do the squad selector on

121
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,320
Monday. So if you guys don't know, a lot

122
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,600
of you will because you're OG's. We've

123
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,680
always done a live stream where we've

124
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,479
gone through the squad I would pick

125
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,000
today if the World Cup was kind of, you

126
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,040
know, in the next week. It's always

127
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,840
really good fun. So, make sure you join

128
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,759
me on the James Ra channel for that. So,

129
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,840
Belling and the thing about TUL bringing

130
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,400
him out or or leaving him out or

131
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,240
dropping him or whatever it is, he's got

132
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,560
a valid reason. I think it helps with

133
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,000
the this group in terms of allowing them

134
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,400
to kind of stick their chest out to the

135
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,720
likes of Anderson to kind of really have

136
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,560
his place within this squad. Declan Rice

137
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,040
more and more. Although he's obviously

138
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,320
he's not new Declan Rice. Um Gordon

139
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,000
Rashford, a lot of them. I just think

140
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,759
Bellingham's such a big personality.

141
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,199
You're going to want him back. You know,

142
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,440
the squad is going to want him back. And

143
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,160
I think also the squad will accept him

144
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,880
back. But having these other guys

145
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,800
knowing knowing their role, but also

146
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,800
having an important role within the

147
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,199
these camps, I think it's really really

148
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,800
really important because I think

149
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,120
Jubelling is one of the few sort of

150
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,720
louder characters within it. And so

151
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,560
yeah, I just think it allows the status

152
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,199
of the rest of the group to to to fly

153
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:30,400
up. The problem this will cause down the

154
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:35,280
road is as I say, has Tool got the

155
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:36,800
minerals to leave out Palmer, Trent,

156
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,680
Foden,

157
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,160
and Bellingham and Wharton down the

158
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,160
road. I I don't think he has. I think

159
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,240
look, Foden has got much much better

160
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,520
recently. Can he keep that going? If you

161
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,880
can keep that going, you're going to

162
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,199
want to look to try and get him in.

163
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,440
Right. Wharton. Wharton is the one that

164
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,120
I'm really angry about if I'm honest. Um

165
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,720
I don't understand why Loft Cheek is

166
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,800
here. He will not be going to the World

167
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,199
Cup in my opinion. He's, you know, not

168
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,080
really starting for AC Milan. Generally,

169
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,600
Warton is, you know, a superb footballer

170
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,680
and

171
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,360
more of an obvious option to replace

172
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,160
someone like Anderson or to play in

173
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,160
front of Anderson as well. He's just an

174
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,520
exceptional player and I I don't think I

175
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,160
don't understand why Loftish Cheek is

176
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,600
there if I'm honest. So I think Walton

177
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,560
should have been in the squad unless

178
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,000
there's something that I haven't read

179
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,560
yet and if that's the case let me know

180
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,039
in the comments down below. But when

181
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,919
you've got the likes of Palmer and Trent

182
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:34,000
and Bellingham and Foden and maybe

183
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:35,919
Greish knocking about as well and Mowki,

184
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,880
who are you going to take out of this

185
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:41,280
group? And if you do take the, let's say

186
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,759
you take them out, right?

187
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,840
Is it gonna be Gibbs White? Is it gonna

188
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:50,520
be Morgan Rogers?

189
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,520
Is it going to be Bowen for Mowki?

190
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,199
Is it going to be Loft Chic? You know,

191
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,039
is it going to be Es like who like who

192
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,479
knows? But the point is that these

193
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:02,800
players are the key members of this

194
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:05,599
group right now. A group that is, you

195
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:08,880
know, doing doing pretty well.

196
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:13,360
So when you make those changes, are you

197
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:15,840
going to erode all of that team dynamic

198
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,080
um building that you've that you've

199
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,840
allowed yourself to build? That's the

200
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,520
thing that's going to hurt him. I think

201
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,440
just on the loft chic thing, like you

202
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,120
know, also someone like Curtis Jones,

203
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,360
why is Curtis Jones not ahead of Loft

204
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,800
Chic? I don't understand that. Tuk must

205
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,639
know something or not. I don't. Maybe

206
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,080
it's, you know, from his Chelsea days or

207
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,560
something like that. I don't really get

208
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,080
it. Um not bringing another right back.

209
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,599
back. I think someone like Tyreek

210
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,680
Mitchell is a little bit unfortunate

211
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,759
here. Yes, he's playing in a different

212
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,199
formation, but he's being allowed to

213
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,800
attack and then get back. That's the

214
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,400
similar thing that he would do here. So,

215
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,560
I think that's a little bit like I would

216
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,000
like seen Tyret Mitchell in here and

217
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,599
Spence as like one of these other

218
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,520
fullbacks and you bring Tyret Mitchell

219
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,759
here. I don't think you need five center

220
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,280
backs here, but it's not that big a

221
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,919
deal. You know, it's not worth kind of

222
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,039
getting too angry about. And then in

223
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,000
terms of the selection for the two

224
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,759
games, it's going to be interesting to

225
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,080
see what he goes for in the two of them.

226
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,319
I I expect the one thought I had was

227
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,599
that Bowen would start at some point. I

228
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,879
think Bowen will either start the Wales

229
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,720
game or the Latvia game. I think he'll

230
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,800
probably start the Wales game and be

231
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,879
given an opportunity. So, it's a huge

232
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:20,319
huge

233
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:22,720
um set of games for Jared Bowen because

234
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,639
I think you know he's captain, he's of

235
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,319
West Ham, he he's dealing with that kind

236
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,479
of pressure. This is a real real

237
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,919
opportunity for him to kind of jump the

238
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,159
queue in terms of Madaweki because you

239
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,599
might go Sack and Mowki. Are they a

240
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,200
little bit too similar? I think I don't

241
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,440
know. I mean, they're not that similar

242
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,279
to be honest, but Bowen does bring a

243
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,039
different kind of spark. So, I think he

244
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,200
needs a big big performance against

245
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,560
Wales or Latapia, depending on which one

246
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,760
he starts. And I think he will start one

247
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,440
of them for him to to sort of give

248
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,800
himself a real chance because there's a

249
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,040
really difficult decision on that right

250
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,560
hand side there. And then the same goes

251
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,320
for these guys in the middle. I think

252
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,959
that it's a really really tricky time

253
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,720
for Gibbs White as a loft cheek and

254
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,240
Rogers less so loft cheek. I just don't

255
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,080
see him being part of it personally. I'm

256
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,800
not trying to hammer him and maybe I'll

257
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,800
be wrong. That's and that's cool.

258
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,800
But for these guys with those other

259
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,360
names that we've spoken about, I would

260
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,200
expect at least two of those in

261
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,800
Bellingham and Palmer to be involved

262
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:21,360
obviously, right? So two of these guys

263
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,160
might not make the final squad for the

264
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,480
World Cup. So they someone needs to like

265
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,480
really really take the Bad Horns with

266
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,720
this one. Roger struggling for form for

267
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,320
for Aston Villa. Gibbs White, you know,

268
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,519
Forest aren't doing great either. So, I

269
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,279
think it's those two that are really in

270
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,880
the firing line. I think EZ will with

271
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,440
the sort of big club tax in terms of

272
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,959
Arsenal will help him in his desires to

273
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,800
be in that squad and obviously he's

274
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,480
going to be a key figure for Arsenal as

275
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,279
well and you'd expect him to do well.

276
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,600
So, Rogers and Gibbs White massive for

277
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,640
them as well. Anderson to continue on

278
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,320
what he's been doing. He's been

279
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,959
absolutely brilliant in that last set of

280
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,720
games. You want to see the same again.

281
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,240
Um and Declan Rice, I think, has been

282
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,519
superb as well. and it's going to be

283
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,040
interesting to see what kind of team he

284
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,959
sets up and if he continues down the

285
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,600
road. So, go check out the whole video I

286
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:07,600
did on the Serbia game. I do think there

287
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,279
is some elements he's taking from Bayern

288
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,200
Munich in terms of the way that he's

289
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,480
getting the best out of Kane. Let's just

290
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,600
go to it here because I think this was

291
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:19,519
the lineup and we spoke about it on that

292
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,920
that day that Kane he he was quite happy

293
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,000
to sort of drop deep once they lost the

294
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,920
ball and then Pigford could pick out

295
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,279
Harry Kane. Will they continue to do

296
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,920
that? That's something for you guys to

297
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:32,240
keep an eye out on. And obviously Malawi

298
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:36,240
not in this one. How will Jarro Bowen or

299
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,760
Sacka enjoy and thrive in that scenario?

300
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,839
Interesting stuff. Who missed out for

301
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,880
you? Um how are you feeling about it?

302
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,959
Make sure you join me for the squad

303
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:46,720
selector and uh I'll speak to you soon.
