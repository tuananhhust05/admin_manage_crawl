1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,880
So, uh, yeah, early early pod this week.

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:06,879
Uh, we've got some, uh, good bits, some,

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,320
um, pieces. We've got, uh, we got to

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:10,639
talk about probably the big teams

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:16,080
really. Arsenal, how how many games has

6
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:18,080
he got? He's on the edge. Feels like um,

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,000
people bit confused by Liverpool. I

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,600
think this I think I don't think we've

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,039
had a Premier League season where people

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,880
have been this confused about all the

11
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,960
teams.

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,480
Which team are you absolutely certain

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,160
are brilliant?

14
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:39,880
I don't want to say it.

15
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,880
Has given an A.

16
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,039
I don't know. I can't answer that

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,160
question because the only answer I've

18
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,000
got is the one I don't want to say.

19
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,039
Yes, it might begin with an A.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,120
Right. All right. Well, cuz I've got on

21
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,640
here, Arsenal, are they good?

22
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,519
Simple question. We can discuss that if

23
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,119
you'd like.

24
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,040
Well, yeah, I'd love to discuss that,

25
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,200
but just not right at the beginning,

26
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,280
like sort of middling so that if any of

27
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,680
our fans do watch, they have to work for

28
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,000
it.

29
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,799
Sure.

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,560
Is that fair?

31
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,640
Understandable. Understandable. Last

32
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,400
week, we got annoyed about I got annoyed

33
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,600
about Ekitica getting booked for taking

34
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:27,119
his shirt off. Um, and I yeah, I was

35
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,560
just intrigued to know uh it well it was

36
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,640
intriguing to find out what people

37
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,439
think. Some people were saying so Paul

38
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:36,400
Casey, shout out to Paul Casey this week

39
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:40,880
who I know has been uh speaking Japanese

40
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:42,720
for a long time and uh he did a comment

41
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,640
and then I'm scrolling down and he must

42
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,079
have just sort of kept watching and he's

43
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,159
made another comment on the same issue.

44
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,119
Not something I see a lot of if I'm

45
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,960
honest,

46
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,240
but both of enough quality for me to go,

47
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,680
"Yeah, I'll have that one." And then I

48
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,200
go, "Yeah, I'll have that one as well."

49
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,159
And they were both Paul Cases. Well

50
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,200
done, Paul.

51
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:03,280
Two comments at different times in

52
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,439
clearly in the podcast. One's one's like

53
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,680
much much later on, both five days ago,

54
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,319
so both in the same sitting, I think.

55
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,959
Um, but and yeah, I don't I'd love to

56
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:15,200
know if uh of of our dry slugs, how many

57
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,879
of you are double dippers or you know,

58
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,640
do you save yourself for when do you

59
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,319
comment? Do you comment in the heat of

60
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,840
the moment? Do you com do you sort of

61
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,840
gather your thoughts because I want this

62
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,120
to be good so it might get read out like

63
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,120
where is everyone at?

64
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,480
It's funny you say that cuz some people

65
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,720
might be watch listening to the audio

66
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,319
version of this on Spotify and I found

67
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,480
that the comments on Spotify the

68
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,879
spiciest it's the spiciest place on

69
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,360
earth

70
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:39,599
on Spotify. Very prickly.

71
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,080
They are very prickly. That's

72
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,040
interesting.

73
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,720
Have you noticed this?

74
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,599
I think I have now. Now you're saying

75
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,720
it.

76
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,400
I think I know why.

77
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,879
Prickly. Go on. Faceless.

78
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,879
Yes. Potentially. But I think moreover

79
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,480
they usually in a podcast you're

80
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,800
separated by something, right? You're

81
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,720
not able to comment directly in that

82
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,680
moment and lots of points are made over

83
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:04,640
a long period of time on a on a podcast.

84
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,400
But on Spotify, they're looking at the

85
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,120
podcast. the comments options are right

86
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,480
there as you listen and you you you're

87
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,239
able to comment when you're most

88
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,879
triggered by whatever's been discussed,

89
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,440
right?

90
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,760
Go. There's less

91
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,080
Yeah.

92
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,680
balance in Spotify comments.

93
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,080
Do you think as well with Spotify

94
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,640
because it's still it's it's in the it's

95
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,840
just a baby when it comes to commenting

96
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,319
commentating comment commenting that uh

97
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,760
you know, you've got to really want it.

98
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,319
You got to really have an axe either an

99
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,159
axe to grind or some love to give. And

100
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,640
love's love you can keep within, can't

101
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,080
you? It's nice to hold that glow. But

102
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,280
when it's when it's angry, you want to

103
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,239
get the poison out.

104
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,879
Get it out.

105
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,159
Yeah. Um

106
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,159
Yeah. Paul, the big question Matt

107
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:51,519
Bradbury says, the big question, Paul,

108
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:54,080
is was it in the same poo?

109
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:58,000
How many I reckon there's about 10% of

110
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,920
our audience that watch us mid poo?

111
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,680
What?

112
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,200
I don't feel comfortable if I'm going

113
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,599
for a p. I don't want other people's

114
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,799
faces.

115
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,319
Someone's someone's listening or

116
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,239
watching this right now

117
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:12,239
and they they probably just just as I've

118
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:15,239
just before I've said it, they've gone

119
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,239
and

120
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,639
here this could be a new bit, right? Do

121
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,680
you know is like

122
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,759
the what's a weird love pang? Right?

123
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,199
Ready? Do you know what love pang is?

124
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:32,320
Uh so I think I could guess but go on. A

125
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:35,199
love pang is when so I'll send my

126
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,040
beloved wife of eight years anniversary

127
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,440
this week.

128
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,840
Yeah. Um

129
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,600
close up.

130
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,080
That's a love pang. That's a love.

131
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,320
Yeah. Love wang. That is the uh No, the

132
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,160
love pang is if I sometimes you get like

133
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,880
a feeling or you remember something and

134
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,880
you get ah you're like ah

135
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,199
got a little love pang there

136
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,639
and I and uh I'll send fam a little

137
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,800
message when when I get a love pang.

138
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:03,040
often we code who

139
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,759
I wonder who pangs the most.

140
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,320
Yeah.

141
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,600
Uh

142
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,320
I reckon you pang the most.

143
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:11,520
Yeah. Quite a feeling based person,

144
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:14,240
aren't I? It would seem. So So yeah, I I

145
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,639
probably do pang. I pang regularly. And

146
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:20,160
uh but yeah, do you know a very strange

147
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:22,560
thing love pang I have with my son is

148
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,880
when you got to take him to have a to go

149
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,320
to the toilet. Now, normally he's like

150
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,720
buzzing about looking around, right?

151
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:32,479
He's doing all sorts. But when he then

152
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,400
goes to strain, he gives you this like

153
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:37,180
death, not death stare. It's not fair.

154
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,320
It's just intense like

155
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:41,680
[Laughter]

156
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,840
and you get to look at him in all his

157
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,919
you get not all his glory, but like you

158
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,080
get to look at him for a long period of

159
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,600
time and he's looking at you for a long

160
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,639
period of time. So you get this bizarre

161
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:55,039
like I you get the love pang of like oh

162
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,320
my god I love you so much but you are

163
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,880
this isn't the

164
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,560
yeah this isn't the ideal moment maybe

165
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,479
do you do that with your partner people

166
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,039
out there you know does how long does

167
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:08,080
that go on for

168
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:10,000
mate anyway if you is there a always

169
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,960
scanning yeah that's it that's f he's

170
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,479
going to be a player

171
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,639

I was like yeah

wearing his QPR kit.

178
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,160
So So this people won't know about this

179
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,000
but I stayed over at James' house when

And um and and so he was going to

184
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:44,000
football training and James wanted him

185
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,520
to wear for obvious reasons a QPR shirt.

186
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,800
However,

187
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,080
James' wife wants him to fit in. So, he

188
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,280
doesn't want to feel awkward when he

189
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,520
goes to the football training.

190
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,759
Yeah.

191
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,000
And they haven't they have already

192
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,039
agreed kit that all the kids would wear.

193
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,919
So, they all feel like they belong to

194
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,560
the same team.

195
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,240
James,

196
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,400
one of us is white. One of us is an

197
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,919
ethnic minority. You guess. You guess

198
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,440
which one's which. See, I'm I'm

199
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,919
desperate. I'm feel free. I want to be

200
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,120
different. Poor Poor Stacy. She's

201
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,360
thinking, "Look, just let the kid fit

202
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,800
in."

203
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,319
Oh, I see. I wonder I didn't know where

204
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,840
you was going, but I guess you get

205
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,280
nervous. Yeah, just Yeah, a little bit.

206
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,800
Yeah, but then you're talking about your

207
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,280
own family, so what can you say? You can

208
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,240
say what you like.

209
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,360
Take it. So,

210
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,520
you can pretty much say what you like, I

211
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,360
think. Um, yeah, but I love the fact

212
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,000
that James said no.

213
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,560
The boys wear boys got to wear his kit.

214
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,280
Yeah,

215
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,639
his kit, doesn't he?

216
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,520
Um, anyway, yeah, he worked today and he

217
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,960
was

218
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,160
Before we get into the crux of this

219
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,479
episode, Jim, I've got something that's

220
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,720
been bothering me. You know this.

221
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:39,280
Go on.

222
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,840
Give me his full name. Carl Hines

223
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,759
Rumiger.

224
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:45,919
Rumiger. Um he you nervous to say that

225
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,280
name.

226
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,840
Don't acknowledge it then it's not a

227
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,160
problem.

228
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,400
Right. That's his name. Kh rumiger.

229
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,120
Yeah. No. Don't stop. Let's now you've

230
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,440
made it a thing.

231
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,400
Why?

232
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,960
Now I can't.

233
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,639
Because you

234
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,599
That's his name though, isn't it?

235
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,280
What I'm saying? I'm trying to wash it

236
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,560
away. You don't need to feel worried

237
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,400
about saying the last part of his name.

238
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,680
You brought it up. You brought it up. I

239
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,240
didn't say anything at all.

240
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,479
Okay.

241
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,080
I was just saying why did you get me to

242
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,840
say what did you do? I know when you're

243
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,360
going cuz you'll you'll have a go at the

244
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,000
name. you normally you'll have a go at

245
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,280
the name

246
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,879
and then have a laugh about it whereas

247
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,560
this goes oh James

248
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,879
I couldn't remember his first name was

249
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,639
Carl Hines that's why so I gambled on

250
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,919
cohines and you you were really quick to

251
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,879
say it weirdly you might be waiting for

252
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:28,400
this

253
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:31,039
um he has come out and he's called

254
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,680
Newcastle idiots for stumping up 65

255
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:36,080
million pound for what could be the

256
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:39,120
greatest nine football has ever seen in

257
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,479
Nick Wmire

258
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,320
um all right he's not going be that. But

259
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:45,040
he is a lovely player and I like him.

260
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:48,560
He's two [ __ ] brilliant oldfashioned

261
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,880
Duncan Fergusones headers first. Yeah.

262
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,800
Yeah.

263
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,160
But he's Yeah. Anyway

264
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,800
and I'm like and he's like oh no they're

265
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:57,120
idiots in England there's an idiot tax

266
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,800
because we got so much money. You got by

267
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,160
So he says Stokart must have been over

268
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:04,399
the mind to find idiots uh extreme

269
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,640
enough to pay 65 million pound or 80

270
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,839
million euros for Tomato because

271
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,600
obviously Bayern Munich wanted to buy

272
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,959
them as well. Yeah.

273
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,519
Hang on a minute.

274
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:15,440
Sour. What's What's Hang on.

275
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,240
Let me just see what it is in German.

276
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,720
German. Yeah.

277
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,080
Yeah.

278
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,160
Hang on a second. Isn't Aren't you the

279
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,000
club that do this to all the other

280
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,519
German football clubs? You're the

281
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,760
financial powerhouse.

282
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,600
Zen,

283
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,720
I can even play. I'll play it for you.

284
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,160
Zora.

285
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,519
And if you like,

286
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,800
you can't hear it, but people will be

287
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,399
able to hear in the pod.

288
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,640
Zhaen.

289
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,959
Zhaen.

290
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,080
Yeah.

291
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,600
Yeah.

292
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,800
Uh it's not just him, it's the other

293
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,000
directors as well. They're all putting

294
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,040
their foot in. They're all putting their

295
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,160
boot in it.

296
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:50,080
And it's because they wanted Volto Mada.

297
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,240
And it's for obvious reasons that

298
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,240
Newcastle overpaid.

299
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,480
You would say they they paid more, but

300
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,480
the circumstances

301
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,839
is what's really winding me up. And the

302
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,839
sort of the you know, it's double

303
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,399
standards because how much they've spent

304
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:11,360
on Lewis Diaz? 75 million100 million

305
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:13,360
pound for Harry Kane [ __ ] Alise come

306
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,040
and picking Alisa like they can do what

307
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,519
they want in that league and win it.

308
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:20,720
They've there's been one winner in the

309
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,240
last 13 seasons once has one other team

310
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,519
won it other than Bayern Munich and that

311
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,440
was Leverkusen. M

312
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,720
so

313
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,240
don't like don't like then then because

314
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,640
you you haven't been able to get one

315
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,480
player then sort of go oh I know idiots

316
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,240
because they're willing to pay east it

317
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,800
was eack money that Newcastle spend

318
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:42,000
why are you so angry about this

319
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,600
because I don't know actually I don't I

320
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,440
was just listening to it and I was like

321
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,800
[ __ ] annoyed I'm I'm still bitter

322
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,200
that they they managed to get Bayern

323
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,440
Munich sorry Harry Kane out of us

324
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,640

325
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,120
and I'm like that is

326
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,640
Matt Bradbury one of our beloved

327
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,240
moist slugs. We've got some great

328
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,040
comments this week, by the way, from dry

329
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,560
and moist. One person who has become

330
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,000
moist, which I'll I'll read out in a

331
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:05,120
bit. But if you do want to join us,

332
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,640
become a patron, please do. Uh we do a

333
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,240
bonus podcast where we just talk about

334
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,240
stuff that isn't really football. And

335
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,640
it's I think a lot of the moisties think

336
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,839
it's actually better than this. So, uh

337
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,160
if you would like to join us, then

338
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,240
please do. Um but anyway, Matt Bradbury

339
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,640
says, "Jaffen has already solved this

340
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,440
one years ago. Once you've got the money

341
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,839
to spend, you've got to spend it. That

342
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,399
is how that Sorry. Once you've got the

343
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,880
money to spend and you've spent it, that

344
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,760
is how much the player is worth. Next.

345
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,160
Next.

346
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,200
Yeah.

347
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:38,720
Yes. Someone tell [ __ ] Romania this.

348
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:42,160
It is a wo What did you say? The It is a

349
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,440
woeful take. It's

350
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,720
the thing you got to do though. You got

351
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,320
you got to step away. You got to step

352
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,120
away from getting

353
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:53,360
cuz he's he's getting pissy because he's

354
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:55,920
not got his own way. Right. So

355
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,240
I think it's it's about a cal calm push

356
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:01,200
back here that the point is is the

357
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,920
market is the market is the market and

358
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,880
as you said

359
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:10,160
it's look the money that they've been

360
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:15,120
able to spend is and the money that have

361
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:17,760
taken and asked for is based on the very

362
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:21,040
clear knowledge that you've just made a

363
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,959
load of money on isach and this happens

364
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,279
Like so forget the leagues for a second

365
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:27,600
and look the league there is a Premier

366
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,959
League tax and they're kind of they kind

367
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,160
of should be

368
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,480
should be yeah

369
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,240
because they have got the money and

370
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,680
that's how negotiations work like if

371
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,600
you're negotiating with like in YouTube

372
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,519
like if you've got certain brand certain

373
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,959
brands you could kind of go well no I I

374
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,639
know you I know you've not got much

375
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,560
money you're a you know you're a startup

376
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,880
blah blah blah whatever or like or

377
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,560
you're a charity or whatever it might be

378
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,160
but when it's like when It's like when

379
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,440
it's a bigger brand, you go, "Well, I

380
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,959
should be able to kind of

381
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,480
be a bit punchy here." And that's

382
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:59,360
exactly the same. The same goes the one

383
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,040
I always think of is Middlesbrough sold

384
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,639
I think they sold like Jed Spence and

385
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,560
they sold a couple of other players for

386
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,320
like big money couple of seasons ago. I

387
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,880
think when Chris Wilder was the manager

388
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,399
and and and so they were then looking

389
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,920
for players that would come to the

390
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,720
championship

391
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,720
and all the other teams were kind of

392
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,399
holding them to ransom a little bit

393
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,839
because

394
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:23,120
they've got money. So, it's it's just

395
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,000
they should everyone should be kind of

396
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:28,079
paying a bit more and

397
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,200
it's about like the pain percentage I

398
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,160
think

399
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,760
like

400
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,560
the fact that you've got this you know

401
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,880
the fact you've got that amount of money

402
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,560
to be able to spend means that you can

403
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:42,240
spend that money which means that's how

404
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:45,200
much he's worth to you the end.

405
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:48,399
Can I just ask is there an option to buy

406
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,839
a Nicholas Jan Jackson deal to Bayern

407
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,120
Munich from Chelsea?

408
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,480
Say that again.

409
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,920
Is there an option to buy?

410
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,079
I think so.

411
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,279
Yes, I would think so as well. Right.

412
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,399
So, let me there's a couple of things I

413
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,199
want to pick apart in terms of this

414
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,839
deal.

415
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:10,160
There is an option to buy which is worth

416
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:13,440
70.5 million for Nicholas Jackson.

417
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:15,519
Yeah. Which is a

418
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,120
You would on paper would have to say

419
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,480
Nicholas Jackson because he scored goals

420
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,560
in the Premier League, but we all know

421
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,199
he isn't, right? We all know he's bit

422
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:25,519
rubbish, but but Bayern Munich have

423
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:28,160
agreed to do it.

424
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:32,079
Secondly, they have paid a loan fee to

425
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:36,240
Chelsea of 14.3 million, which is about

426
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:40,399
a third n about a quarter more or less

427
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:42,880
of what has cost Newcastle. So what are

428
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,240
you even talking about? I did actually

429
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,560
find it funny though when one of the

430
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,560
director

431
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,680
and is the 14 million sorry is the 14

432
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:51,279
million is that aside or as part of like

433
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,839
if you have to pay whatever that number

434
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,920
was you said was it 70 something

435
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,240
is that 14 on top of the 70?

436
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,560
No t typically loan

437
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,040
the loan fee comes off of the option to

438
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,160
buy.

439
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,199
Right. Right. Got you.

440
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:07,360
Typically typically

441
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:09,360
makes sense. Um, yeah. So, so,

442
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,480
so we're in, we're in a situation where

443
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,440
it doesn't really make much sense.

444
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,120
They're just bitter that they haven't

445
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,120
been able to. And what more do you need

446
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,760
to win the league? You've got possibly

447
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,160
the best striker in in in in the world

448
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,920
already. You've got Elise, who's an

449
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,800
unbelievable talent. You've got your

450
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,480
team is so much. You bought Palinia for

451
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,079
close to 60 million pound and didn't

452
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,920
even play him.

453
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,360
What are you on about?

454
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,959
I don't know why I'm angry about it. I

455
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,600
don't know why why I'm angry about it. I

456
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,639
I just

457
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,800
It's very sour. It's It's sour and it's

458
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:41,040
It's really sour. It's really sour. It's

459
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,079
really unnecessary as well. Like move

460
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,440
on. Move on.

461
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,079
Shut up. It happened like two weeks ago,

462
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:49,199
you [ __ ] And also three weeks ago.

463
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:50,720
And also, James, isn't this good? This

464
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,720
is brilliant for German football and

465
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,480
brilliant for Stokart. They are funding

466
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,800
your league.

467
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,800
Yeah. I also I think the fact that he's

468
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,800
you know a German international and will

469
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,880
be for the foreseeable future.

470
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,040
I find that weird as well. Like it's

471
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,800
like he's like triple bitter because you

472
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,120
know a fellow German shouldn't be doing

473
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,519
this. Like you should be choosing Bayern

474
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,920
Munich who are you know there's always a

475
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:17,040
not joke or it's a known thing that

476
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,079
Germany is Bayern. you know, partly down

477
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,920
to because you got better players, but

478
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,440
also there's always a feeling that the

479
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,959
players that should be in the team end

480
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,519
up not being in the team because Bayern

481
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,880
Munich players get in the team. So, I

482
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,120
don't know, maybe that's playing a part

483
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,560
in it. I think there's a double um

484
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,399
there's an element of embarrassment for

485
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,000
a very

486
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,720
someone who's clearly got quite an ego

487
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,920
here that like we Munich, what on earth

488
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,440
are you doing?

489
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,759
Yeah, there's a few people in the chat

490
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,279
going, we know why you're hungry. Sorry,

491
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,839
hungry. What I'm talking about?

492
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:48,240
We know why. I'm not actually. We know

493
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,639
why you're angry. It's because they took

494
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,759
Kane and I'm like, "Yeah, because

495
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:55,360
weirdly, Jim, weirdly because I'm I

496
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,759
belong to a club that's in the Premier

497
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,240
League. I think I'm better than Bayern

498
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,720
Munich."

499
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,680
All right. Sorry. Dig at me.

500
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,079
You think you're better than me? Do you

501
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,480
think you're better than me then?

502
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,480
No, I not you, Jim. Probably

503
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,280
about it. Thanks for taking Thanks for

504
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,839
taking the question seriously.

505
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,079
Appreciate it.

506
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:16,400
Let me explain. Jim,

507
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:18,079
am I better than you because the team

508
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:22,400
you didn't have a choice in supporting

509
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:24,480
isn't in the same league as mine?

510
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,240
The right answer is no, isn't it? No.

511
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,120
No. I I don't I don't think I'm better

512
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:32,320
than you in any shape or form. Right.

513
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,760
But all the other QPR fans 100%.

514
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,240
Yeah.

515
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:41,120
Okay.

516
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:43,760
Um Yeah. Careful. Uh, Paul Paul

517
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:46,080
McCallendon. Another Paul here. Um, have

518
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:49,880
a nibble on some bread, Flav. You know

519
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,880
you have it next to you.

520
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,360
Have you got any food near you? That's a

521
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,880
good thing.

522
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,240
I'm not hungry. I'm not hungry.

523
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,480
Have you got food near you, though? Have

524
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,160
you got like safety food near you?

525
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,400
Not safety food. I got some of that, but

526
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,640
shouldn't show that.

527
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,080
That's

528
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:08,320
free. It I've got um I've got water.

529
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,240
I've got and I've got I've got the

530
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,840
snacks I steal from Spotify. Every time

531
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,160
I leave Spotify, I steal loads of

532
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,600
snacks.

drain our attention

545
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:44,240
you know vile human beings who pay to

546
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,760
watch this anyway um Luke's trying to

547
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,799
George Pet just said oh that's what we

548
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:51,360
do but Luke's Luke's just said mad the

549
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:53,520
flav used to roast me for still liking

550
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,960
Bellingham and Jim for following Ez but

551
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,720
yet still in love with Kane I'm not in

552
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,880
love with Kane Kane, I don't care what

553
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,720
happens with Kane. I don't care unless

554
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,919
he comes back. Then I'm like, "Oh, come

555
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,919
on. Come back today."

556
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,919
Do you think he'll come back? You

557
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,320
presume he'd come back? I I generally

558
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:11,600
presume he he'd come back.

559
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:12,799
I can't imagine him doing it any if he's

560
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,559
going to break the record, he's got to

561
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:17,120
break it with us. I think the fact that

562
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,720
Daniel Levy isn't there anymore is a big

563
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,640
thing because you remember Daniel Levy

564
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,720
stole his career.

565
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,840
I mean, just fine, but yeah, I know what

566
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,679
you mean,

567
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,360
James. there. We know the reason why

568
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,799
he's disrespected in the way that he is

569
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,400
where to this day he doesn't get the

570
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,160
credit he deserves.

571
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,000
18 goals in 10 games or something

572
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,480
mental. I heard on the radio earlier

573
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,039
there's a reason why I tell you this.

574
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,200
I'm not proud of this James

575
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:43,280
we we stole his career. We sapped every

576
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,640
tiny little bit out of him and he wanted

577
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,320
to leave. We wouldn't let him.

578
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,720
We wouldn't let him. He was trapped in

579
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,400
that six year contract to [ __ ] ages.

580
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,320
Halfway through it he wanted out James.

581
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,000
He was going please let me leave. Look

582
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,919
at what I've given you. And You ever

583
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,919
know the truth about that? Was halfway

584
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,280
through you think he was he wanted out?

585
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,799
We know that that he did because that's

586
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,559
when he did the interview with

587
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,799
Okay. And you think I was right right?

588
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:06,160
Well, he said I think 100 million pound

589
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,760
would be the right fee for me and we

590
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,520
were like [ __ ] shut

591
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,120
you shut your mouth.

592
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,760
Yeah. And you keep scoring goals for

593
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,520
Spurs.

594
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,559
Gobling up the goals.

595
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,360
Yeah.

596
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:19,200
He loves goals, doesn't he? [ __ ]

597
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,679
He loves goals.

598
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,360
Yeah.

599
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,600
Like you know like there was a bit of a

600
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:26,480
dig on Shira from Keane. say he was a

601
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:28,799
bit he was a bit nasty as a player.

602
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,520
I don't think Kane's Kane's not Kane's a

603
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,880
bit cheeky in the He's a bit sly.

604
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,679
Yeah, he loves drawing a foul.

605
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:38,240
He loves draw, but he's never distracted

606
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:40,960
from his main aim. He's just chewing on

607
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,280
some lovely goals.

608
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,919
Just chomping on goals. Just eating

609
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,200
more. Just gave me the goal.

610
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,520
He loves it. Maybe that's why he wanted

611
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,960
to go to B. Maybe that was it. It's not

612
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:54,480
about

613
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:57,520
It's about career goals. It's not about

614
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:01,200
Premier League goals and he just loves

615
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:04,880
he [ __ ] lo He loves Is there a

616
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:08,720
footballer who loves something more

617
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:11,120
than Harry Kane loves girls

618
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:14,559
will because Harry Kane is just never he

619
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:17,360
is not satiated. He is never ever ever

620
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:19,600
ever satiated. Goals are pop chips to

621
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,520
him. He's just like whacking them in his

622
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,919
mouth. You cannot cannot get away from

623
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,720
the crunch.

624
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,120
Um

625
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,600
um

626
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,600
I'm trying to think.

627
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,840
Everything I came up with in my brain

628
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:36,880
was stuff I can't really say. So

629
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:39,039
I see I thought um

630
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,039
Lampard loved the shot. Loved the shot,

631
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:43,440
didn't he?

632
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:45,840
Yeah. I was listening. Yeah,

633
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,320
maybe um who loves a tackle. People

634
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:50,000
don't allow tackle anymore. Palino. You

635
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,919
say Palinino.

636
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,640
Richard Dunn loved loved a header.

637
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:56,480
Gobble up a little header.

638
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,799
What's the Pope? Loves a corner. Can't

639
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,159
can't keep away from them. Anyway, um

640
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:04,000
just on the patron thing quickly because

641
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:06,720
this made me laugh. Shan Bahangal

642
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:10,400
said seven eight years to eight years as

643
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:13,039
a proud dry slug until last night when I

644
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:15,200
dreamt that I was filling in the Jaffen

645
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:16,960
patron form. Not lifting the

646
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,280
championship trophy for my beloved CV.

647
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:22,480
Not climbing Everest. Just ticking boxes

648
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:24,480
online. It's the driest dream ever. And

649
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,720
maybe a damning indictment of a life

650
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:31,120
slowly being consumed by screens and AI

651
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:34,240
slop. But it worked. I finally gone

652
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:36,400
moisty. Moral of the story, inception is

653
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,240
the way to the dry slugs. Good.

654
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,799
It isn't. It's never too late.

655
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:43,919
Everybody, if you like the idea of

656
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:46,559
giving us money, just go ahead with it.

657
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:50,320
What this screams to me

658
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:55,120
is the the irony of

659
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:59,760
having the driest dream ever related to

660
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:01,440
being a moist slug, right? Has has led

661
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:04,640
you to the promised land of not being

662
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:08,159
dry anymore. And thus being a moisty is

663
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:10,240
inevitable. So really, you're just

664
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:13,120
slowing down the inevitable, which is

665
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,240
pointless. So become a moisty. The

666
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,440
link's in the description.

667
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,240
Job is done.

668
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,440
Click the link.

669
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,559
Yeah, get yourself.

670
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,240
I'm just gonna take this moment to bring

671
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:21,280
us back on track a little bit here, Jim.

672
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,640
I do want talk about Liverpool

673
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,000
struggling.

674
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,200
Yeah, let's talk about that. I'd love to

675
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,039
talk about that. But I want to talk

676
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,919
about Coventry City.

677
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:31,520
Hey, Lampard done a good job. And

678
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:33,200
because of that, I just you just think

679
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,120
like what where where's Coventry

680
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,159
situated? Sort of Midlands. Sort of

681
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,880
Midlands.

682
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:42,240
Yeah. 10 minutes outside of uh

683
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:44,000
Birmingham. Um, and you know, look at

684
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,600
all the money Birmingham City has spent.

685
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,720
Commentary ain't been able to do that.

686
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,880
Third in the league, aren't they?

687
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,480
Just a well-run football club that don't

688
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,320
lose games. And Birmingham have lost

689
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,280
two. All the money they've spent.

690
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,559
We're only two points off him. So

691
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:58,640
yeah, early days. Early days.

692
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,400
Two. We could go above them tonight.

693
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,480
I just like the idea that every

694
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,159
Lampard people have been [ __ ] on

695
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,000
Lampard as a manager. Shouldn't have got

696
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:09,039
the Everton job. Shouldn't have got the

697
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,720
Chelsea job. Inexperienced. Derby was he

698
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:12,320
was the reason he got Derby up was

699
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,559
because Mason Mount and Tamori played

700
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,720
for him. They had Harry Wilson as well

701
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:18,640
up top. They were too good not to

702
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,400
perform to that degree. And then he's

703
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,400
gone in at Coventry who were second

704
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,799
bottom of the league when he took over

705
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,320
and they're flying. So I want to say

706
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,640
let's give him his flowers.

707
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,159
Yeah.

708
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,520
And let's really look at the failings of

709
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,760
Birmingham despite spending all the

710
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,919
money.

711
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:34,640
I mean he came into a good squad. I will

712
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:35,919
say that he's taken off of Mark Robbins

713
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,640
who'd like put together a brilliant

714
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:38,480
squad.

715
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:42,799
Very true. and only two points ahead of

716
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:45,039
us and they beat 7-1. So, who's really

717
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:45,679
on the ascendancy here?

718
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:46,000
Indeed.

719
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,679
Well,

720
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,679
let's talk about Liverpool then.

721
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:54,640
Yes, let's do it. Yeah, because

722
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:57,279
then I'm confused. Flav,

723
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,480
they are they're good, but are they

724
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:00,640
good?

725
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,320
Cuz backto-back defeats Chelsea at the

726
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,840
weekend. Oh, do you know what was

727
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,360
mental? I just went to Tesco's an hour

728
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,720
ago. Guess who I bumped into? I

729
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,320
literally bumped my trolley into him and

730
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:12,320
he looked at me like he thought I was

731
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:15,279
doing it to rile him up.

732
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:17,840
You'll never guess. So I'll tell you.

733
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:18,559
Gacho,

734
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,720
what?

735
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:22,880
Yeah, I just bumped into guy cuz he's at

736
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,480
Chelsea. So they're all like live around

737
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,520
kind of this way.

738
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,880
Did you know that?

739
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,080
Transfer. Yeah, it was quite

740
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,840
he was with his Yeah, he was with with

741
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,880
his mom doing the shop doing the big

742
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,760
shop.

743
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,520
You you you bumped into Gacho. literally

744
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,960
bumped into Gacha and he looked he

745
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,600
stared at me and I was like I don't know

746
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,880
if he was like just not best pleased

747
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,480
because I bumped into him.

748
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,720
Yeah, he needs his legs for football.

749
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,000
Yeah,

750
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,960
I'm not bumped into him. I bump into his

751
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,600
trolley.

752
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,840
Ah, who how disguised was he?

753
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,440
He had a he had a hat and a hood.

754
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,919
Yeah, I was going to say you need that.

755
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,120
But it was 20° today in London. So was

756
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,440
he hot?

757
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,400
Uh he had shorts on as well. So it's not

758
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,720
I mean it wasn't too hot.

759
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,320
I I cannot understand that from Chelsea.

760
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,480
I really don't understand it. I know if

761
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:06,480
there there's a PSR

762
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:09,840
um you know spending opportunity or or

763
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,440
or advantage by selling Mke and then

764
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,760
buying Ganachio because you can spread

765
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,760
it over 5 years or whatever it might be

766
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:19,600
whereas 52 million pound on the books is

767
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:22,080
immediate but Mke in my opinion I'm

768
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,760
[ __ ] sick of talking positively about

769
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,840
Arsenal's players but I was talking

770
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,919
about good how good Maker was when he

771
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,919
was at Chelsea and I was really confused

772
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,760
about all Arsenal fans were going no

773
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,120
he's no good the what are are you

774
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,279
seeing? Do you even [ __ ] watch

775
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,960
football? The kid is good.

776
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,880
How there was there was close to

777
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,919
protests about this signing. It was

778
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,720
pathetic.

779
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:44,640
This kid is mustard and he's he's he is

780
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,720
and he will have twice the career of

781
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,400
Garnacho. So, how they sold him and

782
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,320
brought in and and I appreciate they

783
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,840
played on on typically on different

784
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:56,159
wings, but it did feel like a light for

785
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:57,200
light replacement. And I just for me

786
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,279
is twice as good.

787
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,760
That's interesting. I think well I chat

788
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:03,679
to Cabs yesterday did the Spotify pod

789
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,360
and I I think we didn't totally drill

790
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:07,600
down on it but I I definitely think

791
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,600
there's something in

792
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:12,000
well I this sounds obvious but like the

793
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,760
second season of a player like the first

794
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,520
season everyone's deciding if you're

795
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,960
rubbish or not and you kind of almost

796
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:20,320
just need to get through that first

797
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:23,200
performance or first season

798
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,480
and in that second season when you feel

799
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,760
you know you got the rhythm of the

800
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,200
league you got the understanding of the

801
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,120
pace of the league the physicality of

802
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:32,400
the league where you live, how long your

803
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,840
big shop takes, all those things. When

804
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,799
you've done all those things in the

805
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:38,880
second year, like Nicholas Madson, who

806
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:40,159
on this podcast, I I don't think I said

807
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,279
his name. I might have said his name. I

808
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,360
think it's one of the first times I've

809
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:46,240
gone out and out and go like, "This lad

810
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:49,440
is rubbish last year on the pod." Cuz he

811
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:51,919
was he was awful for us, right?

812
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:55,919
He's he's really, really, really found

813
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:57,520
his feet for us. And I feel like that's

814
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,279
that can often be the case for so many

815
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,399
play like Caluri for example like you

816
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,960
know there's probably other things at

817
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:04,960
play but like you know moving to a new

818
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:08,000
like we forget about all those other

819
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:11,120
things and with Chelsea you've just got

820
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,760
to a place of rhythm I would say with a

821
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:16,159
group there

822
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,520
and then you've got and then you've just

823
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,000
brought in two new wingers and got rid

824
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:23,120
of one like you know you sort of kind of

825
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,039
lost some of that by by changing that in

826
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,520
what is a really quite key area of the

827
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:28,880
pitch. I I really like Pedro Netto, but

828
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,880
like you're going to have to change it

829
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:33,039
about at different times. So, I think

830
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,559
it's one where like Gacho probably will

831
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:36,880
come good. I'm guessing I don't like who

832
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:38,799
knows, right? Gittens as as well is

833
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,200
obviously very talented, but like it's

834
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:43,600
going to take them a year. So, you've

835
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,120
actually kind of g you they need to like

836
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,640
embed

837
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,960
into that team because it's young

838
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,720
enough. you need them to sort of know

839
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,480
each other, become accountable for each

840
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,399
other, understand each other, like and

841
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,960
and I think that's the that's the thing

842
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:59,520
with Liverpool

843
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:02,240
that I wondered at the start of the

844
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:05,440
season with all these new players coming

845
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:08,000
in is this. It's the chemistry thing.

846
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,320
It's such it's so clearly a thing for

847
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,520
me.

848
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:14,240
And did Ann Arnold Swat did not feel

849
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:16,080
like he did he want to change the way

850
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,440
they played? I don't know the answers to

851
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:20,159
these because I was trying to I was

852
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,320
speaking to um our mutual friend Dan

853
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,440
Cook. I do a podcast with him called

854
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,200
Football Between the Lines.

855
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,919
So many great podcasts to enjoy, isn't

856
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,559
there?

857
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:31,840
Yes, almost too many, Jim. But we've all

858
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:33,600
got to make hayw.

859
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:36,159
All right, enough podcast there. No

860
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,840
more. Um but yeah, we we were talking

861
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:39,200
about this and obviously he was ecstatic

862
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:42,320
the fact that Palace, you know, you

863
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,840
talked about teams are they good and who

864
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:46,159
is fundamentally good? Palace are

865
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,520
fundamentally good at at the moment. Um,

866
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:50,000
but I was asking them to try and break

867
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:52,159
down what was going wrong with Liverpool

868
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,919
like what what was it? Why did you find

869
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:56,080
it so easy to get at them defensively?

870
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:59,120
Whereas last season they were pretty

871
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:01,200
imperious for large parts of it. You

872
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:04,320
know, they were almost criticized to

873
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:06,000
some degree of being solid and a

874
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,080
functional Liverpool side. the early

875
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,200
season Liverpool were picking up wins,

876
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:12,720
you know, by one or two goal margins and

877
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,600
putting them in an incredible position

878
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:18,960
to win the league by being functional.

879
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:20,159
And I also called Chris Payjack to try

880
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,480
and find out

881
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:24,960
right

882
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:26,240
what was I do that

883
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,919
anyone you need to call to find out

884
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,399
what's going on at Liverpool, he will

885
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:28,799
give you

886
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:30,399
Chris

887
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,880
a nutshell in five minutes. It's

888
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:31,279
beautiful.

889
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,440
Yeah,

890
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:35,360
but this was this was a couple of weeks

891
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,399
back to be fair. So he he'd been on

892
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,799
holiday, so he didn't give me a great

893
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:41,120
deal. But the the the fact is is that

894
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:43,840
it's hard to pin down why they're not

895
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:46,960
firing. Now some Liverpool fans will go

896
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:48,720
out there and go, "Hang on a second. We

897
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,159
won five games on the B." Was it five

898
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,960
games? Four game. Five games on the

899
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:51,520
bounce.

900
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,919
Who? Liverpool.

901
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,919
Late goals. Yeah, late goals. Was five.

902
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:58,399
Yeah. Um

903
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:01,840
and you know, things are going well.

904
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:05,200
Late goals are a sign of champions.

905
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:06,720
Good. Uh,

906
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,520
did you just press that button then?

907
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,840
Yeah.

908
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,360
Yeah.

909
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,039
I didn't think you'd hear it. So, I was

910
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,159
trying to just sneak it in there.

911
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:14,399
Yeah, I did. I did hear it.

912
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:16,159
Sorry about the browser.

913
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:17,760
I've totally derailed you there. My bad.

914
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:21,120
Yeah, you have. Sorry, mate. Uh, why am

915
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:22,880
I apologizing? You derailed me. The the

916
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,559
Where was I?

917
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,880
You asked Chris Pjack. What's What's

918
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:27,600
going on?

919
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:29,120
No, no, no, no. So, so, so, so the

920
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,720
discussion was being had that that that

921
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,520
is this Liverpool side good at the

922
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,679
moment

923
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:37,200
or is their position at the top of legal

924
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:39,039
force one and the way we kind of come to

925
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,880
the conclusion was we looked at the

926
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:41,600
expected points table that we discussed

927
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,159
last week.

928
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,919
Yeah.

929
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:46,320
And they should be eighth based on

930
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:48,000
expected points which doesn't you know

931
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,760
and and I I don't want this to be true

932
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,559
cuz Spurs should be something like 13th.

933
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,200
M

934
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:54,799
um but there were Liverpool fans kicking

935
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,440
back a little bit at us at that

936
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:59,039
conversation saying you know we're

937
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,559
winning games you know don't don't you

938
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:02,559
worry about it but there's something not

939
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:04,320
right and I want and my qu my question

940
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:05,840
is and I'd love Liverpool fans to answer

941
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,840
this it's not I just don't know the

942
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:10,640
answer and I want to get to it is is it

943
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:12,399
Anna slot changing the way Liverpool

944
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,000
play to make them more exciting you know

945
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:16,240
bought in really lovely players like

946
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,159
Florianz I know he started horrendously

947
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,880
and it's become a story and the pressure

948
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:22,159
will continue to grow around him. But

949
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,720
you have to get that right if you spend

950
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:26,960
that kind of money. But you put in Isak

951
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,360
who started brilliantly, you know, you

952
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,559
know, KZA having a role that we we

953
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,240
thought he'd probably be dismissed and

954
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:33,679
he's he's becoming an important. So

955
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,679
second season

956
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:37,519
second season. Exactly. Uh and you got

957
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:39,120
the best six in the league in Gravenb.

958
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:40,880
People would might argue or you might

959
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,799
you might say that there's another club

960
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,360
in in North London that might have that,

961
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:45,440
but

962
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,399
Benenko,

963
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,120
not him.

964
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:50,480
The uh uh Yeah. So, so I just I just

965
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,640
want to know what what's going on

966
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,840
because right now they're not good.

967
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:59,039
Right now they are underperforming and

968
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:01,120
that level of expenditure regardless of

969
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:03,200
how much you recouped that's not how the

970
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:05,600
narrative is spun in football media.

971
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,919
It's how much do you spend

972
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,919
it just means that you you expect more

973
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,679
and maybe they will come good. You know

974
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:12,720
the odds for the champions them winning

975
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:14,240
it haven't changed. They're still

976
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,080
favorites.

977
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,559
Even though they got beat by Galatas

978
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,600
last night,

979
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:22,240
they expect more.

980
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:24,000
Uh that I think that is part of it. Like

981
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,960
when you spend that kind of money, you

982
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,360
go, "All right, instant results. Off you

983
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:31,519
go, boys." And that's like that's what

984
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:34,080
I've been saying like it does not it

985
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:36,880
will take a minute. This season it is

986
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:38,559
trickier. A few thoughts, right? One,

987
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:42,000
the expected points thing. One thing I

988
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:43,279
would chuck out there, right, Liverpool,

989
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,279
and I'm not saying this is right or

990
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:47,840
wrong, but I'm saying it maybe it's it's

991
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:49,679
um it's a crack in the expected points

992
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,600
table

993
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:54,159
is

994
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:56,960
if you get a couple of goals up, you

995
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:58,480
then maybe chill out a bit in a game and

996
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,159
that can and what we have seen with

997
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,360
Liverpool is that they go to up and then

998
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:04,240
they haven't been able to like shut it

999
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:06,480
out in the same way they, you know, like

1000
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,320
would that would that have been the same

1001
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,480
if it had been would their expected

1002
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:13,359
points somehow actually be somewhat

1003
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,800
higher if they were if the game was

1004
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:16,159
tighter and they're going and going and

1005
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,280
going at them whereas once they're two

1006
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:18,879
goals up they just stop.

1007
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,879
Yeah. Yeah.

1008
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:25,040
So games plays a part in it. That's one

1009
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:28,240
thing. Uh yeah like the this the players

1010
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:30,320
that have been bought

1011
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:33,919
have been bought for the next five. It's

1012
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:35,599
about the next six seven years not about

1013
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:37,200
this year. It's almost because they've

1014
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:38,240
won the league. It's almost difficult,

1015
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,919
more difficult than the fact that

1016
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:42,000
they've won the league in a way.

1017
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:43,280
Like they would for the world, but the

1018
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,800
expectation is through the roof now

1019
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,480
because they've won the league and you

1020
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,639
expect them to get better than the team

1021
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,720
they had last year and it might be

1022
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:52,399
better. The more possibilities, the

1023
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:54,480
ceiling might be higher, but like you

1024
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:56,800
say, Jim, it could be two or three years

1025
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,560
until you see it. I think that also like

1026
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,800
the balance the balance thing is

1027
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,880
somewhat of an issue

1028
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,720
because

1029
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:09,119
the this team's not going to be Salah's

1030
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:10,640
team in two years time. It's going to be

1031
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:12,960
Vertz's team. I know he's had a

1032
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,359
difficult start, but

1033
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,520
yeah,

1034
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:16,960
I was watching that

1035
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,880
I was watching the positions he was

1036
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,920
getting. His movement is really clever.

1037
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,119
The only thing he maybe does a little

1038
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,040
bit too much is he comes a little bit

1039
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:26,960
too close to the ball at times, but that

1040
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:28,960
can actually be beneficial um if you get

1041
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,440
it right. And he technically generally

1042
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:35,119
does get it right. I in the Galatas

1043
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:37,040
game. It was a bad game, but if I

1044
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:38,160
watched I was interested because we're

1045
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,920
going to be we're never going to do a

1046
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,880
video on Verts and like you know why why

1047
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,040
is he struggling a little bit. So I

1048
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:45,520
started to like do a bit of digging and

1049
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:47,920
I looked at all of the his passes and he

1050
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:49,920
gets he gets into lovely positions, gets

1051
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:52,000
the ball, affects the sort of speed of

1052
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:55,119
the game a little bit, gets the defi the

1053
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,839
defense sort of um

1054
00:35:55,119 --> 00:36:00,400
sort of nervous and does affect the

1055
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:03,200
game. But I think I watched about 25

1056
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,800
passes from his game against Galatessay

1057
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,280
and I don't I think he gave the ball

1058
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:10,400
away once

1059
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:12,880
but but in about 15 of those passes the

1060
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,839
person who he passed to they gave the

1061
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,720
ball away.

1062
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:19,119
Yeah. And there when he got the ball in

1063
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,320
certain central areas instead of wide

1064
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:22,480
areas, I think one of the times he gave

1065
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:25,119
the ball away or a couple of times he

1066
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,560
was quite quite far out wide. When he

1067
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:28,960
got the ball in those kind of central

1068
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:31,920
areas and and they played it to him at

1069
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,520
the right time, he he affected the game

1070
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:37,119
was really neat. There's one bit where

1071
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:39,119
he got it before ech or yeah played it

1072
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:40,880
eert got it back off him. Salah had

1073
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,720
gone. Oh, it's Frim Pong had gone and

1074
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,000
Vertz played this beautiful pass and a

1075
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,920
few of the and the other passes that he

1076
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
was giving the ball away. They were

1077
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,960
actually good passes and and difficult

1078
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,640
passes.

1079
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,720
James, you need to release this video

1080
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:55,119
now, not in a week. I'm thinking about

1081
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,079
it. I should do this video. Release it

1082
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:56,480
now.

1083
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:58,240
Okay.

1084
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,160
Do you know what the Liverpool fans need

1085
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:02,000
to hear this? They need to hear someone

1086
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,359
saying this. This is I'm not saying play

1087
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,640
the game here, Jim, but play the [ __ ]

1088
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:04,880
game. This is exactly what you need to

1089
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,880
do.

1090
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:09,359
We play the game. Play the game. You got

1091
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:11,599
to do it right. We we we've got a I I

1092
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:13,839
did a um I did a whole thing on Palace

1093
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:16,240
and and Liverpool. I watched that whole

1094
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:17,280
game. Um we've got this like with the

1095
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:20,320
Premier League, we've got this tactical

1096
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:23,599
cam now and it's just it's so good, so

1097
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:25,680
useful. And uh and anyway, but yeah, but

1098
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:28,720
I did I I sort of smashed through a

1099
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:30,640
video which could have put on the on in

1100
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:32,000
the shed, but we wanted to like really

1101
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,680
really edit it and make the point. So,

1102
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,880
we're taking we we decid that's a

1103
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,079
decision we've made as a team recently

1104
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,320
is though. It's not about being first.

1105
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:41,040
It's about like being of a high level.

1106
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:43,440
So, we will we'll do that. Um, but yeah,

1107
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:47,760
I the to give away that video a little

1108
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:50,880
bit. The problem is not verts.

1109
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:52,000
The problem is not verts for me. It's

1110
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,359
Liverpool fans.

1111
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,760
It's Liverpool fans.

1112
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:55,920
Yes.

1113
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:58,079
It's the It's the uh It's the GA

1114
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,079
brigade, the double, you know, it's the

1115
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:02,720
fact it's the price tag. Like, it's all

1116
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:04,640
those things. He is a little bit you

1117
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,880
think you know he's thinking maybe a

1118
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:08,640
little bit too much at times and other

1119
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,640
players are not always on his wavelength

1120
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,320
and that he hasn't I don't think he's

1121
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:14,320
really really really been given the keys

1122
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,720
just yet

1123
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,240
but

1124
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,720
it's so good that you're you're doing

1125
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:21,440
this Jim right this is what why you you

1126
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:23,280
know you have the respect within the

1127
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,640
industry that you do have and people

1128
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,680
like you really understand the game

1129
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:28,400
because I had lunch with my dad earlier

1130
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:31,040
and he went

1131
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,880
good creator in his own right. Yeah,

1132
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,960
just ain't good enough, is he, girl? I

1133
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,000
mean, what do you mean, Dan?

1134
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,599
Ain't got it.

1135
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,800
Anyone can play in the German league.

1136
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:40,560
Anyone.

1137
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,839
And that was the sum total of why he

1138
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,560
won't make it in the Premier League. So,

1139
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:46,480
there you go.

1140
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:48,480
Yeah, man. I I I think wait. But like

1141
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:52,880
the only thing is, you know, if a player

1142
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:55,040
sort of crumbles in these scenarios, but

1143
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,880
also it's about getting players in the

1144
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,720
positions they want to be and then

1145
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,079
having the players around him once he

1146
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,160
gets it.

1147
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:05,680
And that's the same for a lot of these

1148
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:08,560
teams. And the ones that do it the

1149
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,680
quickest will will be the most

1150
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:12,400
successful. The problem you've got with

1151
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:14,800
Liverpool, there's too many of them. I

1152
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:17,119
that's that's I don't think I'm

1153
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,720
struggling with

1154
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:20,800
I'm struggling with that team in terms

1155
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:23,599
of all of the all of those players all

1156
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:25,599
together. That's that's the thing I'm

1157
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:28,800
when I'm watching them, it doesn't feel

1158
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:31,680
like it has that flow. And I don't think

1159
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:33,119
I think not made a mistake, but I do

1160
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:36,640
think it's maybe hurting them a little

1161
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:38,560
bit selling Lewis Diaz.

1162
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:40,960
Yeah. Yeah, potentially. But you kind of

1163
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:42,240
have to get if they're going to outlay

1164
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,680
it, they've got to find money back. And

1165
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,359
that kind of money from Bayern Munich is

1166
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:47,599
insane, isn't it? Because,

1167
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:49,200
you know, they just pay massive inflated

1168
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:52,880
price. It's idiot tax really when you're

1169
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:55,359
selling to Bayern Munich. But um the the

1170
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:57,680
other issue, Jamir, is they have to

1171
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:59,280
stack their squad because everyone

1172
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,160
around them is stacking their squad.

1173
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,599
Yeah.

1174
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:05,200
You can make five subs in the Premier

1175
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:06,800
League now. Um your club is expected and

1176
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:09,599
Liverpool's expected to challenge on

1177
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:11,359
four fronts, which is impossible to do

1178
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:14,000
if you haven't got a big squad. So, they

1179
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:16,160
they've done the right thing. They've

1180
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,720
improved, you would say, on paper, the

1181
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:20,880
squad they had last season.

1182
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:23,040
It's just going to take a lot a little

1183
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,760
bit more time for it to click and gel.

1184
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:27,599
And Anna Slott's a great manager.

1185
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,960
He'll get it right. It just isn't

1186
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:31,119
working right now as all.

1187
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:33,280
Yeah, it's going to take it takes the

1188
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:36,400
the chemistry takes time, I think. And

1189
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:38,880
he has been changing it quite a lot.

1190
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,079
Uh and you've had, you know, like Sosa

1191
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,200
playing at right back or playing in

1192
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,720
midfield, he's been playing in lots of

1193
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,400
different positions. So Bos, you know,

1194
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:47,599
he'll do a job there at times, but on

1195
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:49,760
occasion it'll also maybe backfire a

1196
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:51,040
touch, but there might be games where it

1197
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,880
actually is quite useful as well when

1198
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,240
you're chasing it. The one thing I did

1199
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,800
want to chuck out there.

1200
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,400
Yeah.

1201
00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:00,400
Would

1202
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:03,520
Liverpool have a sort of better

1203
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:05,440
balance maybe if they'd not sold Lewis

1204
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:08,560
Diaz

1205
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:13,359
and they'd not bought Isach, but they'd

1206
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:17,119
bought Voltoard instead. Oh.

1207
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:18,960
Oh, I think I've just come, Jim.

1208
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:20,880
Do you know what I mean? Like status

1209
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:24,400
wise, I think you would have had

1210
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:26,240
Echk and Voltoas battling out kind of

1211
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,760
kind of similar players in certain areas

1212
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,520
that they want to be in. You'd still

1213
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:34,560
have that zip and pace from

1214
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:36,800
on the left hand side of Diaz and

1215
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:38,560
and maybe I don't know if maybe verts

1216
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,520
wouldn't totally work as well. I don't

1217
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:43,599
know. Uh

1218
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:45,599
the answer in the short term is perhaps.

1219
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:49,760
The answer in the long term is no. Isak

1220
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:51,520
is the it could be but very good point.

1221
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,520
So they have to they have to do it and

1222
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:55,599
and and if the opportunity to buy him is

1223
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:57,920
there you know you look at Gawkarez who

1224
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:00,079
looks like a bumbling idiot at times

1225
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,640
and and what they could have had with

1226
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:04,240
ESAC if they were willing to go that far

1227
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:07,280
or if they had the financial

1228
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:10,000
capabilities of doing it.

1229
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:14,720
Do you think if and just to sort of like

1230
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:16,560
copy and paste all these signings if do

1231
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:19,040
you think I I think everyone's being

1232
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:20,319
quite patient with Liverpool really

1233
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,359
they're kind of going it will come good

1234
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:23,839
it will come good because you got too

1235
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:26,079
much quality there if those players had

1236
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:29,599
been bought by

1237
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:33,359
Man United or Arsenal or Chelsea do you

1238
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:35,440
think there'd be that same patience?

1239
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:38,400
No. Do you think people getting angry

1240
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:41,119
quick? desperately after maybe not

1241
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:43,119
patience you would suggest you would

1242
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:44,480
suggest comes from the fan base patience

1243
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:46,960
is what you expect from your own fan

1244
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:49,119
base it's where scrutiny from the wider

1245
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,760
footballing community would harsh you

1246
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:51,440
think

1247
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,359
yeah probably not like people were

1248
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,599
desperate for cockaress to be terrible

1249
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:57,200
it's weird it was like this hate watch

1250
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:58,960
universal hate watch that everybody was

1251
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:01,440
involved in and it was a beautiful

1252
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:03,280
moment like you know this is like

1253
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,640
cuz the funny thing is Liverpool top

1254
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:08,240
Liverpool like we just had this

1255
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:11,119
conversation like They're they like

1256
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:12,720
they're like they're a bit off, aren't

1257
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:15,599
they? You still you know it's still

1258
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:17,040
edible. Like they're top of the league.

1259
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:20,640

All right. There's some uh there's big

00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,160
teams down there. There's Ajax down

00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,079
Down there.

1279
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,040
Monaco. Good side.

1280
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:47,359
Mhm.

1281

down there. That's interesting. That's

1285
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:58,240
interesting. Then

1286
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:00,960
Oh, Dortmund. Juventus in midfield in

1287
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:03,520

mate? This comes out tomorrow.

1292
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:13,119
That's weird.

1293
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:14,560
Oh, does it? [ __ ]

1294
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:16,079
It's going to come out tomorrow and

1295
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,800
you're going to be like mid table at

1296
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:18,880
this point.

1297
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,640
All right. Oh, there we go.

1298
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,079
Hey, look. You got to go early.

1299
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:24,560
It's like go early. I didn't realize.

1300
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:28,079
Didn't realize him. Didn't realize. One

1301
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:29,359
must beware hub. Bodo glimpmp.

1302
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:32,079
Probably should have won that.

1303
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:35,920
Buddha glimp. Bod limp. Uh, sorry. I you

1304
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:37,359
know I I uh was faced by I got a I got

1305
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,480
tagged in a tweet and I was like I saw

1306
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:42,640
this

1307
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:44,400
and um it was an undercover an lover

1308
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,880
Spurs fan an lover.

1309
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,200
Yeah.

1310
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,480
I I I don't even remember the point I

1311
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:51,280
would have made. I think it was

1312
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:53,280
something to do with XG and and an not

1313
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,800
winning the XG battle.

1314
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,800
I do remember you making that point.

1315
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,560
Yeah. And Thomas Frank has not been

1316
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,480
winning the XG battle.

1317
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,839
I mean we've No.

1318
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,920
No.

1319
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:06,560
and and I got sort of you know I got uh

1320
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:07,200
informed on that which is fine.

1321
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,280
Um

1322
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,800
is this so there there is this I'd let

1323
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,920
people I'll let people behind the

1324
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,960
curtain of what's happening in the

1325
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:15,280
Tottenham fan base.

1326
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:18,319
What's the seed of doubt with Tottenham?

1327
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:20,160
That's what I wanted to ask.

1328
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:24,240
I can ask I can answer that question but

1329
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:28,720
before that um there is a clutch a cabal

1330
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:32,000
a clan a cult of

1331
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:35,440
an evangelists

1332
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:37,520
who are waiting for Frank to fail and I

1333
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,880
don't know if they're Australians

1334
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,920
I don't know if they're Spurs fans I

1335
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,319
don't know who they are because they

1336
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:44,079
don't they never say who I am a

1337
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:46,000
Tottenham fan season ticket holder for

1338
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:49,359
25 years they never say that they've

1339
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,839
just lurking in the shadows waiting for

1340
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:53,359
this to fail in some degree. So, um

1341
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:56,000
yeah. Uh so that's probably why you

1342
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:57,359
received that message. What the what did

1343
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,359
you say? What was the question about the

1344
00:45:57,359 --> 00:46:00,960
the

1345
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:02,640
doubt?

1346
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:05,920
Most managers leave their job. don't

1347
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:09,359
know if you're aware of this. And what

1348
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:11,040
what I see a lot of time is not the not

1349
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:12,319
the crazy amount of independent thought

1350
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:14,000
like there's just like well this has

1351
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:15,839
been said so off we go and it gets

1352
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:20,800
bigger and bigger and bigger.

1353
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:23,359
Um and with uh with uh Thomas Frank who

1354
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:25,119
uh who I thought start you know has

1355
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:26,400
started the season pretty well in terms

1356
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:27,760
of picking up points and stuff.

1357
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,880
Lost one lost one go.

1358
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:34,800
Yeah. Beat Man City obviously. Uh yeah.

1359
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:37,119
What? Um, obviously the the army the

1360
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:39,440
Frank out army is going to be like

1361
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:40,800
wildly minimal right now, but

1362
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:44,400
No, it's not an army. It's like a

1363
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:46,800
militia. I would say it's a group of 20

1364
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,520
or 30 uh

1365
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,440
what do you call them?

1366
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:51,359
Well, they're just not having it.

1367
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:53,040
No, there's some people there. No, look,

1368
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:58,160
no one's not having it. I just think

1369
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:59,520
that people don't have patience and want

1370
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:02,400
everything to be fixed right now. Now

1371
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:04,880
the criticisms of an sorry Jesus Thomas

1372
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,319
Frank I spent two years talking about

1373
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:08,400
the criticisms of anger that's why that

1374
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:12,480
just fell out of my mouth. um Thomas

1375
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:15,839
Frank is that the the attacking aspect

1376
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:17,839
of our players is

1377
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:19,680
it's not looking great, right? We don't

1378
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:20,400
look very dangerous when we're playing

1379
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:20,720
forward,

1380
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,800
right?

1381
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:24,240
And there's a couple of reasons why that

1382
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,880
might be, right? You got Javi Simmons

1383
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:29,359
who bought in and has been played off

1384
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:33,280
the left and you know eventually will

1385
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:35,920
play in the 10. It's completely relying

1386
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:37,040
on him being very good for Tottenham and

1387
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,400
for good reason. you know, there's big

1388
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:40,880
money coming and and so we should be

1389
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:44,000
relying on him. Um, but what Frank's

1390
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:46,400
decided to do for a large proportion of

1391
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:50,240
his time as manager is have three

1392
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:52,560
midfielders that are relatively similar.

1393
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:55,359
Certainly two. So if you got Pinia

1394
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:59,119
holding and tackling and destroying,

1395
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:59,520
your 10 is either Beraval or Paps are.

1396
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:02,160
Yeah.

1397
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:04,560
And neither of those are tens.

1398
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:06,240
They're not dancy 10, are they?

1399
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:08,000
No, they're not. But they're not

1400
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:10,079
effective in attack tens either. They

1401
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,800
are defensive tens if if that isn't even

1402
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:12,400
a thing. I don't think

1403
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,119
Yeah. Burg's an eight, isn't he? Really?

1404
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:16,400
Sort of like a

1405
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:18,160
Yeah. Yeah. Pretty, isn't he?

1406
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:21,040
Yeah. He's a little blonde [ __ ]

1407
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:22,720
Yeah. Yeah. I don't like blondes. But

1408
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:25,040
there's something about him.

1409
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:27,040
Yeah. And Kinsky, two little blonde

1410
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:30,480
[ __ ] we got. They're both class. But

1411
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:34,160
no, the um but but my point is is that

1412
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:36,720
you need when we're going forward to

1413
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:38,880
have a technical 10. The A 10 who's

1414
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:41,839
gonna

1415
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:43,839
is going to What is that music?

1416
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:44,880
You can.

1417
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:46,960
Isn't it me? I

1418
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,720
think it's you. It

1419
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:50,000
No, it's not my All right. Well, I can

1420
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:52,240
go with the music if you like.

1421
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,200
My music stopped. You're having a rave.

1422
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,640
What's going on?

1423
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,359
Yeah, it's your music. Is it me?

1424
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,880
Um

1425
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:58,160
yeah, it was you. Anyway, [ __ ] you.

1426
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:00,240
That's twice you derailed me in the

1427
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:03,440
first single episode.

1428
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:05,119
Uh you need you need we're not looking

1429
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,960
fluent because we don't have the the the

1430
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:08,960
personnel to play fluent football at the

1431
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:11,200
moment. But what Frank's done is come in

1432
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:12,880
and he's solidified us in the way that

1433
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,839
we would get battered every week. It

1434
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:15,839
never feels like we're going to get

1435
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:18,079
battered. The frustration comes from

1436
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:20,000
when watching Spurs is our lack of

1437
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:23,440
cutting edge going forward, but it will

1438
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:25,599
come. And it it's it's no surprise that

1439
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:27,119
we were desperate to sign Zabinho from

1440
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:30,000
Manchester City because he would have

1441
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:32,240
offered that Stardust on the left hand

1442
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,760
side, that player who can unlock a

1443
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:38,079
defense, you can go past a player and

1444
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:39,920
Yes. So, um, so that's where the

1445
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:41,599
frustration comes. But we don't have to

1446
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,800
worry about that. It's fine. This is a

1447
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:45,200
project that's going to be two or three

1448
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:48,640
years in the making. It's not win

1449
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:49,599
immediately, win now. We are third in

1450
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:51,040
the league in the Premier League. Yeah,

1451
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:53,040
I was just going to say well a couple of

1452
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:55,440
things. First of all, there's five teams

1453
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:58,079
that have scored over 10 goals in double

1454
00:49:55,440 --> 00:50:01,520
digits in terms of scoring goals. You

1455
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:04,000
are one of them. Second thing, you've

1456
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:05,760
got the third best goal difference in

1457
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,680
the league.

1458
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:10,800
Yeah.

1459
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:11,839
Okay. So, I think it's just a bit more

1460
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,400
better than this and that's good, isn't

1461
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:14,160
it?

1462
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,720
It's a bit more regimented, isn't it?

1463
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:17,280
Like

1464
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:19,520
Yeah. It's just not as it's not as free

1465
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,880
flowing as people want. And I get that

1466
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:23,359
you want that. You pay a lot of money to

1467
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:25,520
go and watch your team play, but it will

1468
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:26,960
come. I hope it comes. But right now,

1469
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,800
you got to think positively about the

1470
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,079
situation, find ourselves.

1471
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:32,800
And last bit of football chat before we

1472
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:36,079
get into the other bits and pieces is uh

1473
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:37,760
I've written Man United must win,

1474
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:42,319
to save his job Sunday.

1475
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:45,040
I have no I I have no respect

1476
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:47,359
for Manchester United at all. It's all

1477
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:50,880
out the window for me, Jim. Don't I

1478
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:53,119
respect the people I know who follow

1479
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,880
Manchester United. I respect them and I

1480
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:58,160
feel for them. I'm thinking about Adam

1481
00:50:54,880 --> 00:51:00,559
Makola specifically when I say this.

1482
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:01,680
This way, didn't he?

1483
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:04,640
There was a clip of him after the

1484
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:06,319
Arsenal game saying I' I'd seen it. He

1485
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:08,160
said he'd seen after the Arsenal games

1486
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:10,640
he went I know people are angry but I

1487
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:13,520
seen it. He's like I've seen we're going

1488
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:15,520
to be all right.

1489
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:18,000
sustain the stuff.

1490
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:20,000
But um

1491
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:23,280
but that what is he still doing there,

1492
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,880
Jim? What is he doing there? Why is he

1493
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:27,119
still there?

1494
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:30,720
What is literally talking himself out of

1495
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:32,319
a [ __ ] job after every loss saying I

1496
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,839
won't change. I won't. And I've heard

1497
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:37,920
that before, by the way, of that

1498
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:41,599
rhetoric, that dogmatism. But it's like

1499
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:43,119
it this isn't working. Like someone

1500
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:46,480
needs to grab him by the ears and go,

1501
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:49,520
"It isn't working, Amarim.

1502
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:52,000
Change. [ __ ] change or you'll be

1503
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:53,520
gone." And why Racul hasn't gone.

1504
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,480
All right. Yeah, we probably we've made

1505
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:54,720
a mistake.

1506
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,440
Yeah,

1507
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:59,920
we uh we should probably just get rid of

1508
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:02,720
him. Like even if it's like we haven't

1509
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,920
got a manager lined up or and I hate to

1510
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:06,319
say it because I don't want to see

1511
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:09,520
Palace lose Glasnar because it's great

1512
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:11,520
to see a club that would is middling to

1513
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:13,280
lowlevel Premier League in terms of

1514
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:16,240
their expectations but really be

1515
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:18,960
competitive beat Liverpool for example

1516
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:20,480
18 games unbeaten

1517
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:22,000
that's really good I don't want to see

1518
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:23,599
him go to Man United and Man United do

1519
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,359
well I don't want that but if you're

1520
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:28,400
Rackcliffe you're going right we have

1521
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:30,880
[ __ ] up we can fix this immediately

1522
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:32,960
and they just he is just like that the

1523
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:34,880
problems aren't amorim the problem right

1524
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,240
now is amarim but that that problem of

1525
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:39,680
Manchester United doesn't go away for

1526
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:42,559
Manchester United fans it begins and

1527
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:44,240
ends with the Glazers and then Jim

1528
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:47,440
Ratcliffe is right in the middle of it

1529
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:49,040
like a little festering virus

1530
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,559
wow

1531
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:53,520
uh

1532
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:55,359
the uh some of the guys here Connor says

1533
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:57,040
is Man United fan I would guess he said

1534
00:52:55,359 --> 00:53:00,040
we won't beat Sunderland we can't beat

1535
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:00,040
anyone.

1536
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:04,800
You mean Chelsea?

1537
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:06,720
Um,

1538
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:08,480
yeah. Amazing. And

1539
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,920
you like Sunderland so far, Jim?

1540
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,040
Yeah. We got the Premier League our

1541
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,319
Premier League video this week is on

1542
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:14,960
Sunderland.

1543
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:17,119
Um, and how they're they're so young.

1544
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:18,160
It's cra like all the all the

1545
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:19,760
the average age.

1546
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,920
Yeah. All the sort of principles that

1547
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:24,160
you would think. Get players in who know

1548
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:26,000
the league, you know, get some

1549
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:27,920
experience in there. guys have been

1550
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,319
there, done it, blah blah blah. Even the

1551
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:32,240
manager like, "Nope, none of that. We're

1552
00:53:30,319 --> 00:53:35,440
going to play this way." And they've got

1553
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:37,280
some really good signings and and

1554
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:40,000
they're platforming Granite Jacquer in a

1555
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:41,200
way that's making him thrive and and

1556
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:45,040
they're doing really well.

1557
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:47,520
Jim, can I um can can if there's ever a

1558
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:49,440
a piece of evidence

1559
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:50,960
that you might need if you were to

1560
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:54,079
differentiate

1561
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:55,920
your your your career path and mine,

1562
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:59,200
right?

1563
00:53:55,920 --> 00:54:01,280
it would be that I had to Google after

1564
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:03,599
watching the Nottingham Forest versus

1565
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:05,680
Sunderland game

1566
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:06,960
who the Sunderland manager was and

1567
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:08,079
I struggled to remember his name for a

1568
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,760
while as well. It's fine.

1569
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:11,680
I But Jim, I was looking at him. I was

1570
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:12,079
like, who is who is that?

1571
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:12,720
Yeah.

1572
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:15,920
What is

1573
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:17,040
you don't see his face much?

1574
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,880
I always think that's interesting. So,

1575
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:20,000
like with YouTube, you do a lot of uh

1576
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,520
you do a lot, you know, do a lot of

1577
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,880
thumbnails, right? And it's always

1578
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:26,000
interesting to think like what's the

1579
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:28,319
face? Who's the face of the club? And

1580
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:31,200
for Sunderland, it's Granjaka. It's not

1581
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:33,280
it's not Reggie Lee. J. Sometimes it's

1582
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:35,280
the manager. Sometimes it's a

1583
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:38,160
Sometimes it's a certain player. We

1584
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:40,240
could play that game.

1585
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:41,760
Face of the club. Ready?

1586
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:43,119
You just just give me a name.

1587
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:44,240
I'll start at the top.

1588
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:45,920
Liverpool.

1589
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:47,359
First name. First name. Think of huh?

1590
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:49,040
Slot. Slot. Slot.

1591
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:50,160
Arsenal.

1592
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:53,040
Rice.

1593
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:54,880
Oh, Palace. Glasgnner,

1594
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,520
Tottenham,

1595
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,440
Frank.

1596
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:58,000
Yeah. Sunderland,

1597
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,440
Jaca.

1598
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,319
Yeah. Bournemouth,

1599
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,280
areola,

1600
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:02,160
Man City,

1601
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:04,559
Pep,

1602
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:06,319
Chelsea.

1603
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:07,520
Oh,

1604
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:09,760
it's Mesa.

1605
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:11,359
You think Palmer for me? Everton.

1606
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:12,079
Palmer. No, it is Palmer. It is Palmer.

1607
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:12,480
It is Palmer.

1608
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:14,960
Everton.

1609
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:16,319
Uh, Everton. Um, Greish at the moment,

1610
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:18,720
but Mo

1611
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:21,440
Brighton.

1612
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:23,200
Hersler for me.

1613
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:24,000
Yeah, fair

1614
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,559
silver.

1615
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,280
Silva. Yeah,

1616
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:26,319
silver

1617
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,920
leads

1618
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:28,640
Parker because he'll be the reason why

1619
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:32,720
they

1620
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:33,520
Anton Stack I've got my Bren Brenford

1621
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:37,960
still Frank

1622
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:37,960
Henderson for me still Frank

1623
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:42,480
Man United

1624
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:44,640
Rashford.

1625
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:45,359
No, no, for me it's Rackcliffe and it

1626
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,200
always will be.

1627
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:49,040
Really think Rackcliffe first.

1628
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:50,079
Yeah. Not not for good things, for for

1629
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:51,839
bad things.

1630
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:52,960
Interesting.

1631
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:55,280
Newcastle

1632
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:57,520
Ultima.

1633
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:59,839
Who do I think for Bruno? I think

1634
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:02,720
Aston Villa

1635
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:05,680
obviously Emory, but on the pitch, who

1636
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:06,720
do I think of first? Watkins.

1637
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:08,000
Yeah.

1638
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:09,359
Forest.

1639
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,200
Marinakis.

1640
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:12,319
Yeah.

1641
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:14,240
Burnley.

1642
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:15,839
Estee. Esteev.

1643
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:19,359
Yeah. You like him, don't you? Parker

1644
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:21,280
for me. West Ham, Bowen,

1645
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:23,280
Brady,

1646
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:26,680
and Wolves.

1647
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:26,680
I don't care.

1648
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:32,200
Just don't give a [ __ ]

1649
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:36,400
Could be anyone. Couldn't Couldn't care.

1650
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:38,720
Do you know just to be transparent, I I

1651
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:40,400
look I I wanted to get this bit off the

1652
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:43,520
ground. So, I looked at the bottom of

1653
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:45,280
the thing and I saw wolves and I went,

1654
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:49,000
"If you go back, you wind back." Okay,

1655
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:49,000
let's start at the top.

1656
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:52,960
Could kill us.

1657
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:56,480
Uh, Aras is the name I think of.

1658
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:57,440
Brilliant. Uh, okay. So,

1659
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:00,640
uh, celebration.

1660
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:02,240
Oh, yeah. Before we move on, Ollie H

1661
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:03,440
coming up with a belter and he knows the

1662
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:06,559
answer already.

1663
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:07,680
Says Karen Brady Flav would you

1664
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:09,760
100%.

1665
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:11,200
Yeah. You ready?

1666
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:13,760
Strong woman.

1667
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:16,799
Strong. Like I say, borderline racist.

1668
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:17,760
Yeah. You know, my place a bit posh

1669
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:21,520
maybe

1670
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:23,359
financially dominate me. That's Yeah.

1671
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,319
Can dominate you in and out of the

1672
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:25,119
bedroom

1673
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:28,160
everywhere.

1674
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:30,480
Yeah. Um interesting.

1675
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:33,440
Uh Connor Rally said for Wolves the

1676
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:34,400
Portugal flag. It kind of is that, isn't

1677
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:35,440
it?

1678
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:37,200
Portugal.

1679
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,799
Wait, they have been served by the

1680
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:41,359
nation of Portugal in a way that no

1681
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:44,000
other club has outside of Portugal.

1682
00:57:41,359 --> 00:57:45,040
Yeah. So, celebration police cuz we were

1683
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,040
talking about the shirt being taken off.

1684
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:48,880
Do you remember that an hour ago? Um, I

1685
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:50,319
just did want to get your How did you

1686
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:52,240
feel about Pellini taking his shirt off

1687
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:53,520
after getting the equalizer against a

1688
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:55,760
team that you know nothing about in

1689
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:59,760
Wolves? Were you okay with it?

1690
00:57:55,760 --> 00:58:01,920
Uh, I mean I So, I was so angry at that

1691
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:04,799
point that I didn't move when we scored

1692
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:06,720
that goal. In fact, I was I was just

1693
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:08,000
furious with Tottenham. I was furious

1694
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:11,839
with Thomas Frank. I was furious with

1695
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:15,640
everybody. Um, so I don't look like [ __ ]

1696
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:15,640
anyone who wants to go

1697
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:21,599
get [ __ ] man. Let him celebrate. If

1698
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:23,200
people want to go mental celebrate,

1699
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:26,880
that's what the point of this [ __ ]

1700
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:29,520
sport is, James, is to explode in

1701
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:31,760
emotion. All the tactics, all the money

1702
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:33,920
spent on players, the the ticket price

1703
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:35,440
that gets in, the shitty food or great

1704
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:38,000
food in some instance that you're eating

1705
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:40,079
at certain sta stadiums, everything is

1706
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:43,119
about that moment when the ball goes in

1707
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:46,319
the net, it should be anyway. And so if

1708
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:50,799
that moment in causes you as a player or

1709
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:52,799
as a fan to lose yourself, then

1710
00:58:50,799 --> 00:58:55,040
why would you want to take that away?

1711
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:57,599
unless it's to get one over on your on

1712
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:59,920
your rivals. But but fundamentally, it's

1713
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:02,079
the most important part of of football.

1714
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:03,760
It's the only thing that should matter.

1715
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:05,119
You just got so many bellins that are

1716
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:06,880
putting themselves in the way of the

1717
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:09,040
ball being struck and the ball going

1718
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:10,720
into the net and the reaction to it.

1719
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:12,319
They need to get a life, Jim. I don't

1720
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:14,480
like it. I don't accept it.

1721
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:15,760
Perfect. I couldn't agree more. Uh Paul

1722
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:17,440
Casey, do you remember Paul at the start

1723
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:19,680
of the pod? He didn't never read his

1724
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:22,000
comment out. He said this. Uh taking

1725
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:23,359
your shirt off should mean something. I

1726
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:26,000
don't want shirts to be taken off for

1727
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:29,040
any big standard co goal. That doesn't

1728
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:31,119
make sense. Big standard goal.

1729
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:32,720
I want it taken off for massive late

1730
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:36,000
winning goals where the player says,

1731
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:38,000
"Book me. I don't care." Players taking

1732
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,760
their shot off for an 86th minute third

1733
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,760
round League Cup winner against a team

1734
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:43,599
38 league places below them when the

1735
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:45,359
goal itself was a six-y open goal.

1736
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:48,319
Should be grounds for a straight red.

1737
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:50,880
Never mind a second yellow.

1738
00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:52,079
Big Willie agrees. As a Liverpool fan, I

1739
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:53,520
like the rule because you should only

1740
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:56,160
take a shirt off for a goal if it's

1741
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:58,240
worth getting a yellow card for. You

1742
00:59:56,160 --> 01:00:00,400
should only take your top off for a late

1743
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:02,640
winner against rivals in and in cup

1744
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:04,160
finals. [ __ ] off.

1745
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:06,079
No, because that

1746
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:08,799
So what? So a QBR player can never ever

1747
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:10,480
ever ever take his shirt off unless it's

1748
01:00:08,799 --> 01:00:12,640
against a rival. You you just narrowed

1749
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:14,079
it down to the privilege in that it can

1750
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:15,440
only be when we're in our win our cup

1751
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:18,400
finals, which we're in four every

1752
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:21,359
season. Shut up, Big Willie.

1753
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:23,920
Yeah, big Willie. Um,

1754
01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:26,640
my this is the point is is that when

1755
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:28,640
when a player scores a goal, if they're

1756
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:30,240
instant reaction is that they're so

1757
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:32,799
excited that they want to take the show

1758
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:36,160
off and show their ripped torso, who am

1759
01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:39,040
I to disagree? Absolutely.

1760
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:41,599
Um, Paul Casey came back later in his

1761
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:42,799
session watching Jaffen and uh he gave

1762
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:44,079
us an analogy. He said, "Taking your

1763
01:00:42,799 --> 01:00:47,040
shirt off to celebrate is like a

1764
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:49,040
lunchtime pint. Part of it allure is

1765
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:50,000
that you know you shouldn't do it but do

1766
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:51,280
it anyway.

1767
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,680
Yeah, that's good work, Paul. You

1768
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:55,599
redeemed yourself.

1769
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:57,520
Flav's pallet. This next bit's called.

1770
01:00:55,599 --> 01:00:59,760
Oh, by the way, any celebration police

1771
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:01,839
bits or any celebration stories? Any

1772
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:03,920
really nourishing celebration stories? I

1773
01:01:01,839 --> 01:01:05,520
would love to hear moments where you got

1774
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:06,640
to tr like celebrate in whatever way

1775
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:08,319
that is. Not taking his top off or

1776
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:10,480
anything like that. So, just a moment of

1777
01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:12,079
celebration that's really lovely and

1778
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:15,200
smug and funny. Get that in the

1779
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:16,960
comments. Um, Flav's palette. Uh Joe

1780
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:19,280
Joseph Kapowi said, "Flav's favorite

1781
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:21,920
milk is red top."

1782
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:23,520
Check his hard drive.

1783
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:24,880
It's not my favorite. Semi skims is

1784
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:26,559
everybody's favorite, isn't it? Oh,

1785
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:27,520
okay. Backtracking on that. I thought

1786
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:29,119
you said you like the red top.

1787
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:31,200
You think I'm buy I No, I can't remember

1788
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:33,760
what the point I was making, but no one

1789
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:34,079
was buying red top.

1790
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:36,400
Okay.

1791
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:37,760
No, I said Oh, red. Hang on a second.

1792
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,559
Red top is skimmed, right?

1793
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:40,240
Yeah.

1794
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:42,160
Oh, I see. Yeah, I like skimmed milk and

1795
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:42,559
tea. Yeah, if I have milk at all.

1796
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:44,079
Why?

1797
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:46,240
Sorry, I did. I did say that.

1798
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:47,599
Why? Just I just wanted

1799
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:49,839
It's too much fat. It's too It's too

1800
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:52,079
much fat in it. It's too much milkiness.

1801
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:53,359
I don't want my tea to taste milky. It

1802
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:54,480
needs to taste the tea. I want to taste

1803
01:01:53,359 --> 01:01:58,160
the tea in the tea bag.

1804
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:59,839
Your palette fascinates me.

1805
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:02,480
Well,

1806
01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:04,000
I just like the sort of bitterness. I

1807
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:06,559
like the the bitter. I like

1808
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:09,520
What are your favorite? Do So, do you do

creamy, crunchy, bitter, sour, spicy.

01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:17,040
Amami. Amami.

1812
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:18,400
Yeah.

1813
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:19,920
Okay.

1814
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:22,720
I mean, you you should be up for that.

1815
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:24,000
You're You've married into Amami.

1816
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:27,359
Yeah.

1817
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,319
Well, that's the basis of their mommy.

1818
01:02:27,359 --> 01:02:30,000
Um,

1819
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:31,760
that's her name. I know that. I know.

1820
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,280
Uh, new bit. I really like this. I

1821
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:35,839
really, really love this. Please, please

1822
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:37,839
put more in and and start with the

1823
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:39,520
sentence. Why did I say that? Why did I

1824
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:41,520
say that?

1825
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:42,720
Chris Barker

1826
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:44,319
that. Sorry, that's my favorite one. So,

1827
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:46,160
I'll read the other one first. This the

1828
01:02:44,319 --> 01:02:47,520
second one. I was laughing for ages. I

1829
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:49,280
don't know why it tickled me. Anyway,

1830
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:51,280
plague boy said, "Why did I say that

1831
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:53,280
moment? I was watching a I was watching

1832
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:55,359
a UFC match uh when completely

1833
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:57,280
unprompted." The commentator said, "Both

1834
01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:59,760
fighters having dealt with custody

1835
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:02,240
battles for their children while the

1836
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:03,280
fighters are beating the [ __ ] out of

1837
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:04,799
each other." Co just come through the

1838
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:07,359
door, so I'm not swearing now. There

1839
01:03:04,799 --> 01:03:08,000
wasn't even a lull in the fight.

1840
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:09,280
said play.

1841
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,480
I think I've seen that clip before. It

1842
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:13,040
doesn't make any sense.

1843
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:16,559
That's really funny. This baby giggle.

1844
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:19,280
Chris Parker. Why did I say that? I was

1845
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:21,280
at a party when I was about 16. There

1846
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:23,760
was a girl that I'd flirted with a lot,

1847
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:26,799
but mainly online. At the end of the

1848
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:29,440
party, everyone was loitering around the

1849
01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:32,319
front of the house. The girl comes up to

1850
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:36,039
me and asked if I would walk her home,

1851
01:03:32,319 --> 01:03:36,039
which to which I replied,

1852
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:41,680
Well, how far is it?

1853
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:43,119
It's a fair Well, how far is it?

1854
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:44,640
It's a fair question.

1855
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:48,000
Would you um Would you like to take me

1856
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:51,039
home? Well, how far is it?

1857
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:52,640
Yeah. Not the you know, how far would

1858
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:55,680
you work? How far would

1859
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:57,039
How far would you would you would you be

1860
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:59,039
willing to walk

1861
01:03:57,039 --> 01:04:00,720
in that moment? If she said it's three

1862
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:02,960
miles away, are you willing in in in the

1863
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:06,000
hope that that you would, you know,

1864
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:08,960
eventually get your end away?

1865
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:10,079
Yeah. Is that negging or how far is it?

1866
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:12,160
I mean, maybe you said the right way,

1867
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:15,200
you might get away with it, but like

1868
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:16,799
kind of ruined the moment there, mate.

1869
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:18,400
And he said, "How far is he?" He went,

1870
01:04:16,799 --> 01:04:20,559
"I knew it was close. I don't know why I

1871
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:22,000
said it." She walked away and nothing

1872
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:23,520
ever happened between us. Dawn on me

1873
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,200
later that night. The opportunity had

1874
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:27,599
spurned and still bothers me to this

1875
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:29,440
day. Brilliant. more of those kind of

1876
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:31,599
things, please.

1877
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:34,480
Uh, and last one. Oh, no. Got a couple.

1878
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:35,920
This isn't normal. Pasta Bof said, "I

1879
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:37,280
don't know if this could be a bit, but I

1880
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:38,799
thought it could be funny to hear things

1881
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:40,880
that people have always had in their

1882
01:04:38,799 --> 01:04:42,720
house and one day just realized this

1883
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:44,240
isn't normal."

1884
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:46,160
Um, the reason I find it funny is like

1885
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:48,799
you see it on thumbnails all the time.

1886
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:50,480
We we we've done it a few times where

1887
01:04:48,799 --> 01:04:52,319
you like you have a bit of text on the

1888
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:53,359
thumbnail and and it's this isn't

1889
01:04:52,319 --> 01:04:54,319
normal.

1890
01:04:53,359 --> 01:04:57,839
Yeah.

1891
01:04:54,319 --> 01:04:58,640
Um, okay. Minus the fact who could it

1892
01:04:57,839 --> 01:04:59,839
be?

1893
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:01,520
All right, here we go. Minus the fact

1894
01:04:59,839 --> 01:05:03,839
that my mom regularly steals crockery

1895
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:06,000
from Weather Spoons.

1896
01:05:03,839 --> 01:05:08,319
So much so that I that only a fraction

1897
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,440
of our total table wear doesn't belong

1898
01:05:08,319 --> 01:05:12,319
to spoons.

1899
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:15,440
Your mom's a thief. Are you

1900
01:05:12,319 --> 01:05:17,359
dinner plates, side plates, bowls, the

1901
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:20,079
little baskets they bring out halumi

1902
01:05:17,359 --> 01:05:22,400
fries in, little dipping pots, all of

1903
01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:24,319
it. I realized a couple of days ago when

1904
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:26,240
I was went to make cereal for breakfast

1905
01:05:24,319 --> 01:05:28,640
for the first time in ages, realizing we

1906
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:30,079
no longer owned any cereal bowls, I

1907
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:32,240
stared at the stack of those

1908
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:34,160
unmistakable blue and white floral bowls

1909
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:35,680
and just thought, "This isn't normal, is

1910
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:37,680
it?"

1911
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:39,440
Only

1912
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:40,400
Yeah. I mean,

1913
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:41,200
your mom

1914
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:43,680
Your mom's a faith.

1915
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:45,599
Your mom Your mom's a faith, mate.

1916
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:46,559
It ain't great.

1917
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:48,160
Yeah. Yeah, I mean there there was

1918
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:51,440
things in my when I growing up, I grew

1919
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:55,280
up in a bit of a weird house and um not

1920
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:58,480
my dad's house, but my my mom's partner,

1921
01:05:55,280 --> 01:06:02,000
he he was into sort of um sort of you

1922
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:03,359
know like I don't know like stars and

1923
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
sort of astrology and that sort of

1924
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:05,359
stuff.

1925
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,559
So there was lots of weird bits and

1926
01:06:05,359 --> 01:06:12,640
pieces around the house and uh and there

1927
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:14,640
was a puppet on on on top of on this

1928
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:16,480
this puppet had hung there. It was like

1929
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:18,480
a French trilicus do dummy.

1930
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:21,599
Oh god, that's so scary.

1931
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:24,319
It would h it was just put on, you know,

1932
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:26,240
like um just next to where we hung the

1933
01:06:24,319 --> 01:06:28,960
coats and it would just sort of look

1934
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:30,799
down and and and I would look at it and

1935
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:33,119
I I wouldn't even look it. I was I would

1936
01:06:30,799 --> 01:06:35,440
walk past it with my head down for about

1937
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:37,119
the first 10 years. It used to freak and

1938
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:40,079
I'm like that's not normal having that

1939
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:41,760
and that that isn't who why is the value

1940
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:44,720
here? Not a piece of art. It's just

1941
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:47,200
[ __ ]

1942
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:49,599
That's quality. Uh so yeah, that uh

1943
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:52,160

01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:45,200
the last thing we'll do. I'll just read

1971
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:48,240
these out quickly. So, uh the guy near

1972
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:50,400
me, Ash, uh says, "Uh, we've got a we've

1973
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:52,240
got a got to do better here. Guy near

1974
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:54,079
me. We go one nil down. We've got to do

1975
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:56,160
better. Drawing at halftime. We've got

1976
01:07:54,079 --> 01:07:57,599
to do better. We managed to scrape a

1977
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:59,359
late win. We pulled through in the end,

1978
01:07:57,599 --> 01:08:00,799
but we've got to be better. We've got to

1979
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:02,799
do better." So, he's got to do better,

1980
01:08:00,799 --> 01:08:04,480
guy.

1981
01:08:02,799 --> 01:08:07,440
Uh

1982
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:09,200
and this one. Oh, yeah. This is a Spurs.

1983
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:10,960
Oh, it's Ben. Ben Spantum Walker.

1984
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:11,599
Remember Ben Spantum Walker?

1985
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:13,200
Yeah, of course.

1986
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:14,559
Hello, mate. He said, "Football

1987
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:15,760
characters, around my Spurs season

1988
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:17,600
ticket, there's a guy who leaves five

1989
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:19,199
minutes early every week." As he's

1990
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:21,040
leaving, he looks in the general

1991
01:08:19,199 --> 01:08:24,480
direction of the crowd as he's going

1992
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:27,040
down the stairs and shouts, "Clyide

1993
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:29,040
about four times and puts his thumb up

1994
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:31,440
and disappears into the concourse. We

1995
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:33,759
all assume there's a Clyde somewhere,

1996
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:35,359
but none of us are completely sure."

1997
01:08:33,759 --> 01:08:36,880
Interesting.

1998
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:38,080
Uh, last football character, Harry. Uh,

1999
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:40,000
the football character chat reminded me

2000
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:42,159
of an older guy I sat next to for around

2001
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:44,960
10 years at Goodison Park. My dad and I

2002
01:08:42,159 --> 01:08:46,319
referred to him as hit him. This came

2003
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:48,080
from the fact that we only ever heard

2004
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:50,319
him say around 10 words during the time

2005
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:53,839
we sat there and this was loudly

2006
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:55,920
screaming hit him or [ __ ] hit him

2007
01:08:53,839 --> 01:08:58,239
whenever the opposition had the ball for

2008
01:08:55,920 --> 01:09:00,239
any length of time. This would happen at

2009
01:08:58,239 --> 01:09:02,239
least once during a game for the first

2010
01:09:00,239 --> 01:09:04,719
four or five years. After COVID hit, hit

2011
01:09:02,239 --> 01:09:06,719
him became a bit more subdued and his

2012
01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:08,719
hit screams were reduced massively to

2013
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:10,640
maybe three or four uh once every three

2014
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:11,920
or four games. This made my dad and I

2015
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:14,319
speculate whether something had happened

2016
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:16,159
to hit him's private life. I only heard

2017
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:18,080
him shout two other things at a game

2018
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:19,440
over 10 years. This was once during a

2019
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:22,239
game against Man City where he loudly

2020
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:24,400
exclaimed, "Manchester, wank wank wank."

2021
01:09:22,239 --> 01:09:26,799
And once loudly shouted, "Fuck off

2022
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:29,359
Fulham." whenever we were playing

2023
01:09:26,799 --> 01:09:31,520
Forest.

2024
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:33,120
As a true football character, I I do I

2025
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:35,199
did not know his name or anything about

2026
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:37,199
him. In fact, I've never seen him at any

2027
01:09:35,199 --> 01:09:40,000
other place than that seat at Goodison

2028
01:09:37,199 --> 01:09:42,000
Park. As we left the ground in May, my

2029
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:45,359
dad said that we'd probably never see

2030
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:47,839
hit him again. A true loss. That is that

2031
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:50,000
does that does scare me. Like the day

2032
01:09:47,839 --> 01:09:52,560
you got to move seats or if you know

2033
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:54,480
like we there's no space for Co. If Co

2034
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:55,440
wants to watch me and my dad, we got

2035
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:56,880
figure that out. I don't really know

2036
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:59,520
what to do.

2037
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:02,320
Jim, did did this come from um when I

2038
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:03,679
was talking about the ref at Spurs?

2039
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:05,760
I thought we were talking about the guy

2040
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:06,719
there's a guy who stinks. Oh, you spoke

2041
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:07,199
about someone.

2042
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:08,880
I can't remember.

2043
01:10:07,199 --> 01:10:11,120
Yeah, but there was another guy called

2044
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:13,360
the ref at Spurs who um

2045
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:15,440
I've just seen. Is that you?

2046
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:16,400
Yeah, it could have been me, but no.

2047
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:18,239
That is

2048
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:20,480
all right. Let's move on to that.

2049
01:10:18,239 --> 01:10:22,400
Yeah, that was hung up. It was that in

2050
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:24,560
that clothing as well with that red hair

2051
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:28,400
and the

2052
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:29,440
and it would hang hang above the stairs.

2053
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:31,840
What?

2054
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:35,040
Not not h hanging but like not it was

2055
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:36,239
just placed there and I'm like it's one

2056
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:38,480
of the most scary things.

2057
01:10:36,239 --> 01:10:40,960
That is horrific. Right, here we go.

2058
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:44,400
Ready everyone?

2059
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:50,480
Young Flav here.

2060
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:51,840
What the That is just so grim. Imagine

2061
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:53,440
that.

2062
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:56,800
Yeah, it was there.

2063
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:58,159
Who's making that? And imagine you're

2064
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:00,400
making that. And they're going, "And

2065
01:10:58,159 --> 01:11:01,280
who's this for?" It's for kids. It's for

2066
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:02,000
kids.

2067
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:04,320
Yeah, it's for kids.

2068
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:07,120
It's famous. This This thing This thing

2069
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:09,520
was famous in the 80s when ventriloquist

2070
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:12,719
dummies became popular. This was like

2071
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:13,120
the go-to model for people to practice

2072
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:16,080
on.

2073
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:19,040
The go-to model. The hair.

2074
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:21,120
Grim. So scary.

2075
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:21,520
Got a sad note to end on. But uh there

2076
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:22,400
we go.

2077
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:25,199
Yeah.

2078
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:26,080
Uh right, I'm off to go watch QPR.

2079
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:26,880
Hopefully win again.

Oxford.

2085
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:39,120
Oxford. Yeah. What? Beware

2086
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:41,360
