00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,679
Why do wide receivers prefer lower

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,440
jersey numbers? Well, in the NFL,

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:06,960
certain players are only allowed to

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,800
choose from certain numbers. Wide

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,840
receivers were originally only allowed

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:14,480
to wear between 80 and 89, but in 2004,

7
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,720
the NFL expanded this to include 10 to

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,920
19. The change saw an exodus of players

9
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:22,960
to the lower numbers. And by 2019, 181

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,920
of the 229 receivers in ESPN's player

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,599
database wore 10 to 19. Many changed for

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,960
branding reasons or to honor their

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,720
favorite player, but there were others

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,880
who claimed the lower numbers made them

15
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,719
faster, slimmer, and more agile. Now,

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,559
this may sound like superstition, but

17
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,399
there's actually science to back it up.

18
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,879
Two UCLA experiments found that

19
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,520
volunteers consistently said players in

20
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,920
jersey numbers 10 to 19 looked thinner

21
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,920
than those wearing 80 to 89, even when

22
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,600
the bodies were the same size. It's

23
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,680
theorized that this is because people's

24
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,160
previously learned associations between

25
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,239
numbers influence their perception of

26
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,600
body sizes. Meaning a lower number could

27
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,600
make you actually seem thinner.
